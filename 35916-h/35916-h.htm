<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>This little work embodies the more generally interesting
portions of lectures first written for delivery at the
<span class="smcap">Stevens Institute of Technology</span>, in the winter of 1871-&#8217;72,
to a mixed audience, composed, however, principally
of engineers by profession, and of mechanics; it comprises,
also, some material prepared for other occasions.</p>

<p>These lectures have been rewritten and considerably
extended, and have been given a form which is more appropriate
to this method of presentation of the subject.
The account of the gradual development of the philosophy
of the steam-engine has been extended and considerably
changed, both in arrangement and in method. That
part in which the direction of improvement during the
past history of the steam-engine, the course which it is
to-day taking, and the direction and limitation of that
improvement in the future, are traced, has been somewhat
modified to accord with the character of the revised work.</p>

<p>The author has consulted a large number of authors
in the course of his work, and is very greatly indebted
to several earlier writers. Of these, Stuart<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is entitled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
to particular mention. His &#8220;History&#8221; is the earliest
deserving the name; and his &#8220;Anecdotes&#8221; are of exceedingly
great interest and of equally great historical
value. The artistic and curious little sketches at the end
of each chapter are from John Stuart, as are, usually,
the drawings of the older forms of engines.</p>

<p>Greenwood&#8217;s excellent translation of Hero, as edited
by Bennett Woodcroft (London, 1851), can be consulted
by those who are curious to learn more of that interesting
old Greek treatise.</p>

<p>Some valuable matter is from Farey,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who gives the
most extended account extant of Newcomen&#8217;s and Watt&#8217;s
engines. The reader who desires to know more of the
life of Worcester, and more of the details of his work,
will find in the very complete biography of Dircks<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> all
that he can wish to learn of that great but unfortunate
inventor. Smiles&#8217;s admirably written biography of Watt<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
gives an equally interesting and complete account of the
great mechanic and of his partners; and Muirhead<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> furnishes
us with a still more detailed account of his inventions.</p>

<p>For an account of the life and work of John Elder,
the great pioneer in the introduction of the now standard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
double-cylinder, or &#8220;compound,&#8221; engine, the student can
consult a little biographical sketch by Prof. Rankine,
published soon after the death of Elder.</p>

<p>The only published sketch of the history of the science
of thermo-dynamics, which plays so large a part of the philosophy
of the steam-engine, is that of Prof. Tait&mdash;a most
valuable monograph.</p>

<p>The section of this work which treats of the causes
and the extent of losses of heat in the steam-engine, and
of the methods available, or possibly available, to reduce
the amount of this now immense waste of heat, is, in some
respects, quite new, and is equally novel in the method of
its presentation. The portraits with which the book
is well furnished are believed to be authentic, and, it
is hoped, will lend interest, if not adding to the real
value of the work.</p>

<p>Among other works which have been of great assistance
to the author, and will be found, perhaps, equally
valuable to some of the readers of this little treatise,
are several to which reference has not been made in
the text. Among them the following are deserving of
special mention: Zeuner&#8217;s &#8220;W&auml;rmetheorie,&#8221; the treatises
of Stewart and of Maxwell, and McCulloch&#8217;s &#8220;Mechanical
Theory of Heat,&#8221; a short but thoroughly logical
and exact mathematical treatise; Cotterill&#8217;s &#8220;Steam-Engine
considered as a Heat-Engine,&#8221; a more extended
work on the same subject, which will be found an excellent
companion to, and commentary upon, Rankine&#8217;s
&#8220;Steam-Engine and Prime Movers,&#8221; which is the standard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
treatise on the theory of the steam-engine. The
works of Bourne, of Holley, of Clarke, and of Forney,
are standards on the practical every-day matters of
steam-engine construction and management.</p>

<p>The author is almost daily in receipt of inquiries
which indicate that the above remarks will be of service
to very many young engineers, as well as to many to
whom the steam-engine is of interest from a more purely
scientific point of view.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[&#8220;A Machine, receiving at distant times and from many hands new
combinations and improvements, and becoming at last of signal benefit to
mankind, may be compared to a rivulet swelled in its course by tributary
streams, until it rolls along a majestic river, enriching, in its progress, provinces
and kingdoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;In retracing the current, too, from where it mingles with the ocean,
the pretensions of even ample subsidiary streams are merged in our admiration
of the master-flood, glorying, as it were, in its expansion. But as
we continue to ascend, those waters which, nearer the sea, would have been
disregarded as unimportant, begin to rival in magnitude and share our
attention with the parent stream; until, at length, on our approaching the
fountains of the river, it appears trickling from the rock, or oozing from
among the flowers of the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, also, in developing the rise of a machine, a coarse instrument or a
toy may be recognized as the germ of that production of mechanical genius,
whose power and usefulness have stimulated our curiosity to mark its
changes and to trace its origin. The same feelings of reverential gratitude
which attached holiness to the spot whence mighty rivers sprang, also
clothed with divinity, and raised altars in honor of, inventors of the saw,
the plough, the potter&#8217;s wheel, and the loom.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stuart.</span>]</p></div>

<h1>THE GROWTH OF THE STEAM-ENGINE.</h1>

<h3><i>THE STEAM-ENGINE AS A SIMPLE MACHINE.</i></h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Section I.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Period of Speculation&mdash;from Hero
to Worcester, b. c. 200 to a. d. 1650.</span></h4>

<hr class="c05" />

<p>One of the greatest of modern philosophers&mdash;the founder
of that system of scientific philosophy which traces the
processes of evolution in every department, whether physical
or intellectual&mdash;has devoted a chapter of his &#8220;First
Principles&#8221; of the new system to the consideration of the
multiplication of the effects of the various forces, social and
other, which are continually modifying this wonderful and
mysterious universe of which we form a part. Herbert
Spencer, himself an engineer, there traces the wide-spreading,
never-ceasing influences of new inventions, of the introduction
of new forms of mechanism, and of the growth of
industrial organization, with a clearness and a conciseness
which are so eminently characteristic of his style. His
illustration of this idea by reference to the manifold effects
of the introduction of steam-power and its latest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> embodiment,
the locomotive-engine, is one of the strongest passages
in his work. The power of the steam-engine, and its inconceivable
importance as an agent of civilization, has always
been a favorite theme with philosophers and historians as
well as poets. As Religion has always been, and still is,
the great <i>moral</i> agent in civilizing the world, and as Science
is the great <i>intellectual</i> promoter of civilization, so the
Steam-Engine is, in modern times, the most important <i>physical</i>
agent in that great work.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to attempt to enumerate the
benefits which it has conferred upon the human race, for
such an enumeration would include an addition to every
comfort and the creation of almost every luxury that we
now enjoy. The wonderful progress of the present century
is, in a very great degree, due to the invention and improvement
of the steam-engine, and to the ingenious application
of its power to kinds of work that formerly taxed
the physical energies of the human race. We cannot examine
the methods and processes of any branch of industry
without discovering, somewhere, the assistance and support
of this wonderful machine. Relieving mankind from manual
toil, it has left to the intellect the privilege of directing
the power, formerly absorbed in physical labor, into other
and more profitable channels. The intelligence which has
thus conquered the powers of Nature, now finds itself free
to do head-work; the force formerly utilized in the carrying
of water and the hewing of wood, is now expended in
the God-like work of <span class="smcap">thought</span>. What, then, can be more
interesting than to trace the history of the growth of this
wonderful machine?&mdash;the greatest among the many great
creations of one of God&#8217;s most beneficent gifts to man&mdash;the
power of invention.</p>

<p>While following the records and traditions which relate
to the steam-engine, I propose to call attention to the fact
that its history illustrates the very important truth: <i>Great
inventions are never, and great discoveries are seldom, the</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><i>
work of any one mind</i>. Every great invention is really
either an aggregation of minor inventions, or the final step
of a progression. It is not a creation, but <i>a growth</i>&mdash;as
truly so as is that of the trees in the forest. Hence, the
same invention is frequently brought out in several countries,
and by several individuals, simultaneously. Frequently
an important invention is made before the world is
ready to receive it, and the unhappy inventor is taught, by
his failure, that it is as unfortunate to be in advance of his
age as to be behind it. Inventions only become successful
when they are not only needed, but when mankind is so far
advanced in intelligence as to appreciate and to express the
necessity for them, and to at once make use of them.</p>

<p>More than half a century ago, an able New England
writer, in a communication to an English engineering
periodical, described the new machinery which was built
at Newport, R. I., by John Babcock and Robert L. Thurston,
for one of the first steamboats that ever ran between
that city and New York. He prefaced his description with
a frequently-quoted remark to the effect that, as Minerva
sprang, mature in mind, in full stature of body, and completely
armed, from the head of Jupiter, so the steam-engine
came forth, perfect at its birth, from the brain of James
Watt. But we shall see, as we examine the records of its
history, that, although James Watt was <i>an</i> inventor, and
probably the greatest of the inventors of the steam-engine,
he was still but one of the many men who have aided in
perfecting it, and who have now made us so familiar with
it, and its tremendous power and its facile adaptations, that
we have almost ceased to admire it, or to wonder at the
workings of the still more admirable intelligence that has
so far perfected it.</p>

<p>Twenty-one centuries ago, the political power of Greece
was broken, although Grecian civilization had risen to its
zenith. Rome, ruder than her polished neighbor, was growing
continually stronger, and was rapidly gaining territory by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
absorbing weaker states. Egypt, older in civilization than
either Greece or Rome, fell but two centuries later before
the assault of the younger states, and became a Roman
province. Her principal city was at this time Alexandria,
founded by the great soldier whose name it bears, when in
the full tide of his prosperity. It had now become a great
and prosperous city, the centre of the commerce of the
world, the home of students and of learned men, and its
population was the wealthiest and most civilized of the then
known world.</p>

<p>It is among the relics of that ancient Egyptian civilization
that we find the first records in the early history of the
steam-engine. In Alexandria, the home of Euclid, the great
geometrician, and possibly contemporary with that talented
engineer and mathematician, Archimedes, a learned writer,
called Hero, produced a manuscript which he entitled
&#8220;Spiritalia seu Pneumatica.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is quite uncertain whether Hero was the inventor of
any number of the contrivances described in his work. It
is most probable that the apparatus described are principally
devices which had either been long known, or
which were invented by Ctesibius, an inventor who was
famous for the number and ingenuity of the hydraulic and
pneumatic machines that he devised. Hero states, in his
Introduction, his intention to describe existing machines
and earlier inventions, and to add his own. Nothing in the
text, however, indicates to whom the several machines are
to be ascribed.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The first part of Hero&#8217;s work is devoted to applications<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the syphon. The 11th proposition is the first application
of heat to produce motion of fluids.</p>

<p>An altar and its pedestal are hollow and air-tight. A
liquid is poured into the pedestal, and a pipe inserted, of
which the lower end passes beneath the surface of the
liquid, and the upper extremity leads through a figure standing
at the altar, and terminates in a vessel inverted above
this altar. When a fire is made on the altar, the heat produced
expands the confined air, and the liquid is driven up
the tube, issuing from the vessel in the hand of the figure
standing by the altar, which thus seems to be offering a
libation. This toy embodies the essential principle of all
modern heat-engines&mdash;the change of energy from the form
known as heat-energy into mechanical energy, or work. It
is not at all improbable that this prototype of the modern
wonder-working machine may have been known centuries
before the time of Hero.</p>

<p>Many forms of hydraulic apparatus, including the hand
fire-engine, which is familiar to us, and is still used in
many of our smaller cities, are described, the greater number
of which are probably attributable to Ctesibius. They
demand no description here.</p>

<p>A hot-air engine, however, which is the subject of his
37th proposition, is of real interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a>
<img src="images/illo033.png" alt="Opening Temple Doors" width="350" height="376" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Opening Temple-Doors by Steam,
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 200.</p></div>

<p>Hero sketches and describes a method of opening temple-doors
by the action of fire on an altar, which is an
ingenious device, and contains all the elements of the
machine of the Marquis of Worcester, which is generally
considered the first real steam-engine, with the single and
vital defect that the expanding fluid is air instead of steam.
The <a href="#Fig1">sketch</a>, from Greenwood&#8217;s translation, exhibits the device
very plainly. Beneath the temple-doors, in the space
<i>A B C D</i>, is placed a spherical vessel, <i>H</i>, containing water.
A pipe, <i>F G</i>, connects the upper part of this sphere with
the hollow and air-tight shell of the altar above, <i>D E</i>.
Another pipe, <i>K L M</i>, leads from the bottom of the vessel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<i>H</i>, over, in syphon-shape, to the bottom of a suspended
bucket, <i>N X</i>. The suspending cord is carried over a pulley
and led around two vertical barrels, <i>O P</i>, turning on pivots
at their feet, and carrying the doors above. Ropes led over
a pulley, <i>R</i>, sustain a counterbalance, <i>W</i>.</p>

<p>On building a fire on the altar, the heated air within expands,
passes through the pipe, <i>F G</i>, and drives the water
contained in the vessel, <i>H</i>, through the syphon, <i>K L M</i>,
into the bucket, <i>N X</i>. The weight of the bucket, which
then descends, turns the barrels, <i>O P</i>, raises the counterbalance,
and opens the doors of the temple. On extinguishing
the fire, the air is condensed, the water returns through
the syphon from the bucket to the sphere, the counterbalance
falls, and the doors are closed.</p>

<p>Another contrivance is next described, in which the
bucket is replaced by an air-tight bag, which, expanding as
the heated air enters it, contracts vertically and actuates
the mechanism, which in other respects is similar to that
just described.</p>

<p>In these devices the spherical vessel is a perfect anticipation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the vessels used many centuries later by several
so-called inventors of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>Proposition 45 describes the familiar experiment of a
ball supported aloft by a jet of fluid. In this example
steam is generated in a close cauldron, and issues from a
pipe inserted in the top, the ball dancing on the issuing jet.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a>
<img src="images/illo034.png" alt="Steam Fountain" width="350" height="364" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Steam Fountain, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 200.</p></div>

<p>No. 47 is a <a href="#Fig2">device</a> subsequently reproduced&mdash;perhaps
reinvented by the second Marquis of Worcester.</p>

<p>A strong, close vessel, <i>A B C D</i>, forms a pedestal, on
which are mounted a spherical vessel, <i>E F</i>, and a basin.
A pipe, <i>H K</i>, is led from the bottom of the larger vessel
into the upper part of the sphere, and another pipe from the
lower part of the latter, in the form of a syphon, over to
the basin, <i>M</i>. A drain-pipe, <i>N O</i>, leads from the basin to
the reservoir, <i>A D</i>. The whole contrivance is called &#8220;A
fountain which is made to flow by the action of the sun&#8217;s
rays.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is operated thus: The vessel, <i>E F</i>, being filled nearly
to the top with water, or other liquid, and exposed to the
action of the sun&#8217;s rays, the air above the water expands,
and drives the liquid over, through the syphon, <i>G</i>, into the
basin, <i>M</i>, and it will fall into the pedestal, <i>A B C D</i>.</p>

<p>Hero goes on to state that, on the removal of the sun&#8217;s
rays, the air in the sphere will contract, and that the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
will be returned to the sphere from the pedestal. This can,
evidently, only occur when the pipe <i>G</i> is closed previous to
the commencement of this cooling. No such cock is mentioned,
and it is not unlikely that the device only existed on
paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a>
<img src="images/illo035.png" alt="Hero's Engine" width="350" height="398" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Hero&#8217;s Engine, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 200.</p></div>

<p>Several steam-boilers are described, usually simple pipes
or cylindrical vessels, and the steam generated in them by
the heat of the fire on the altar forms a steam-blast. This
blast is either directed into the fire, or it &#8220;makes a blackbird
sing,&#8221; blows a horn for a triton, or does other equally
useless work. In one device, No. 70, the steam issues from
a reaction-wheel revolving in the horizontal plane, and
causes dancing images to circle about the altar. A more
mechanical and more generally-known form of this device
is that which is frequently described as the &#8220;First Steam
Engine.&#8221; The <a href="#Fig3">sketch</a> from Stuart is similar in general
form, but more elaborate in detail, than that copied by
Greenwood, which is here also reproduced, as representing
more accurately the simple form which the mechanism of
the &#8220;&AElig;olipile,&#8221; or Ball of &AElig;olus, assumed in those early
times.</p>

<p>The cauldron, <i>A B</i>, contains water, and is covered by the
steam-tight cover, <i>C D</i>. A globe is supported above the
cauldron by a pair of tubes, terminating, the one, <i>C M</i>, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
pivot, <i>L</i>, and the other, <i>E F</i>, opening directly into the
sphere at <i>G</i>. Short, bent pipes, <i>H</i> and <i>K</i>, issue from points
diametrically opposite each other, and are open at their
extremities.</p>

<p>A fire being made beneath the cauldron, steam is formed
and finds exit through the pipe, <i>E F G</i>, into the globe,
and thence rushes out of the pipes, <i>H K</i>, turning the globe
on its axis, <i>G L</i>, by the unbalanced pressure thus produced.</p>

<p>The more elaborate sketch which forms the <a href="#Frontispiece">frontispiece</a>
represents a machine of similar character. Its design
and ornamentation illustrate well the characteristics of
ancient art, and the Greek idea of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>This &#8220;&AElig;olipile&#8221; consisted of a globe, <i>X</i>, suspended between
trunnions, <i>O S</i>, through one of which steam enters
from the boiler, <i>P</i>, below. The hollow, bent arms, <i>W</i> and
<i>Z</i>, cause the vapor to issue in such directions that the reaction
produces a rotary movement of the globe, just as the
rotation of reaction water-wheels is produced by the outflowing
water.</p>

<p>It is quite uncertain whether this machine was ever
more than a toy, although it has been supposed by some
authorities that it was actually used by the Greek priests
for the purpose of producing motion of apparatus in their
temples.</p>

<p>It seems sufficiently remarkable that, while the power of
steam had been, during all the many centuries that man has
existed upon the globe, so universally displayed in so many
of the phenomena of natural change, that mankind lived
almost up to the Christian era without making it useful in
giving motion even to a toy; but it excites still greater
surprise that, from the time of Hero, we meet with no good
evidence of its application to practical purposes for many
hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Here and there in the pages of history, and in special
treatises, we find a hint that the knowledge of the force of
steam was not lost; but it is not at all to the credit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> biographers
and of historians, that they have devoted so little
time to the task of seeking and recording information relating
to the progress of this and other important inventions
and improvements in the mechanic arts.</p>

<p>Malmesbury states<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that, in the year <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1125, there
existed at Rheims, in the church of that town, a clock designed
or constructed by Gerbert, a professor in the schools
there, and an organ blown by air escaping from a vessel in
which it was compressed &#8220;by heated water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hieronymus Cardan, a wonderful mathematical genius,
a most eccentric philosopher, and a distinguished physician,
about the middle of the sixteenth century called attention,
in his writings, to the power of steam, and to the facility
with which a vacuum can be obtained by its condensation.
This Cardan was the author of &#8220;Cardan&#8217;s
Formula,&#8221; or rule for the solution of cubic equations, and
was the inventor of the &#8220;smoke-jack.&#8221; He has been called
a &#8220;philosopher, juggler, and madman.&#8221; He was certainly
a learned mathematician, a skillful physician, and a good
mechanic.</p>

<p>Many traces are found, in the history of the sixteenth
century, of the existence of some knowledge of the properties
of steam, and some anticipation of the advantages
to follow its application. Matthesius, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1571, in one of
his sermons describes a contrivance which may be termed
a steam-engine, and enlarges on the &#8220;tremendous results
which may follow the volcanic action of a small quantity of
confined vapor;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and another writer applied the steam
&aelig;olipile of Hero to turn the spit, and thus rivaled and excelled
Cardan, who was introducing his &#8220;smoke-jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Stuart says, the inventor enumerated its excellent
qualities with great minuteness. He claimed that it would
&#8220;eat nothing, and giving, withal, an assurance to those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> partaking
of the feast, whose suspicious natures nurse queasy
appetites, that the haunch has not been pawed by the turnspit
in the absence of the housewife&#8217;s eye, for the pleasure
of licking his unclean fingers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Jacob Besson, a Professor of Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy at Orleans, and who was in his time distinguished
as a mechanician, and for his ingenuity in contriving
illustrative models for use in his lecture-room, left evidence,
which Beroaldus collected and published in 1578,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
that he had found the spirit of his time sufficiently enlightened
to encourage him to pay great attention to applied
mechanics and to mechanism. There was at this time a
marked awakening of the more intelligent men of the age
to the value of practical mechanics. A scientific tract, published
at Orleans in 1569, and probably written by Besson,
describes very intelligently the generation of steam by the
communication of heat to water, and its peculiar properties.</p>

<p>The French were now becoming more interested in mechanics
and the allied sciences, and philosophers and literati,
of native birth and imported by the court from other countries,
were learning more of the nature and importance of
such studies as have a bearing upon the work of the engineer
and of the mechanic.</p>

<p>Agostino Ramelli, an Italian of good family, a student
and an artist when at leisure, a soldier and an engineer in
busier times, was born and educated at Rome, but subsequently
was induced to make his home in Paris. He published
a book in 1588,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in which he described many machines,
adapted to various purposes, with a skill that was
only equaled by the accuracy and general excellence of his
delineations. This work was produced while its author was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
residing at the French capital, supported by a pension which
had been awarded him by Henry III. as a reward for long
and faithful services.</p>

<p>The books of Besson and of Ramelli are the first treatises
of importance on general machinery, and were, for many
years, at once the sources from which later writers drew
the principal portion of their information in relation to machinery,
and wholesome stimulants to the study of mechanism.
These works contain descriptions of many machines
subsequently reinvented and claimed as new by other mechanics.</p>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci, well known as a mathematician, engineer,
poet, and painter, of the sixteenth century, describes,
it is said, a steam-gun, which he calls the &#8220;Architonnerre,&#8221;
and ascribes to Archimedes. It was a machine composed of
copper, and seems to have had considerable power. It threw
a ball weighing a talent. The steam was generated by permitting
water in a closed vessel to fall on surfaces heated
by a charcoal fire, and by its sudden expansion to eject the
ball.</p>

<p>In the year 1825, the superintendent of the royal Spanish
archives at Simancas furnished an account which, it was
said, had been there discovered of an attempt, made in
1543 by Blasco de Garay, a Spanish navy-officer under
Charles V., to move a ship by paddle-wheels, driven, as was
inferred from the account, by a steam-engine.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say to how much credit the story is
entitled, but, if true, it was the first attempt, so far as is now
known, to make steam useful in developing power for practical
purposes. Nothing is known of the form of the engine
employed, it only having been stated that a &#8220;vessel of boiling
water&#8221; formed a part of the apparatus.</p>

<p>The account is, however, in other respects so circumstantial,
that it has been credited by many; but it is regarded
as apocryphal by the majority of writers upon the
subject. It was published in 1826 by M. de Navarrete, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Zach&#8217;s &#8220;Astronomical Correspondence,&#8221; in the form of a
letter from Thomas Gonzales, Director of the Royal Archives
at Simancas, Spain.</p>

<p>In 1601, Giovanni Battista della Porta, in a work called
&#8220;Spiritali,&#8221; described an apparatus by which the pressure
of steam might be made to raise a column of water. It included
the application of the condensation of steam to the
production of a vacuum into which the water would flow.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a>
<img src="images/illo041.png" alt="Porta's Apparatus" width="234" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Porta&#8217;s Apparatus, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1601.</p></div>

<p>Porta is described as a mathematician, chemist, and
physicist, a gentleman of fortune, and an enthusiastic student
of science. His home in Naples was a rendezvous
for students, artists, and men of science distinguished in
every branch. He invented the magic lantern and the
camera obscura, and described it in his commentary on the
&#8220;Pneumatica.&#8221; In his work,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he described this machine
for raising water, as shown in <a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>, which differs from one
shown by Hero in the use of steam pressure, instead of the
pressure of heated air, for expelling the liquid.</p>

<p>The retort, or boiler, is fitted to a tank from which the
bent pipe leads into the external air. A fire being kindled
under the retort, the steam generated rises to the upper
part of the tank, and its pressure on the surface of the
water drives it out through the pipe, and it is then led to
any desired height. This was called by Porta an improved
&#8220;Hero&#8217;s Fountain,&#8221; and was named his &#8220;Steam Fountain.&#8221;
He described with perfect accuracy the action of condensation
in producing a vacuum, and sketched an apparatus in
which the vacuum thus secured was filled by water forced
in by the pressure of the external atmosphere. His contrivances
were not apparently ever applied to any practically
useful purpose. We have not yet passed out of the age of
speculation, and are just approaching the period of application.
Porta is, nevertheless, entitled to credit as having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> proposed
an essential change in this succession, which begins
with Hero, and which did not end with Watt.</p>

<p>The use of steam in Hero&#8217;s fountain was as necessary a
step as, although less striking than, any of the subsequent
modifications of the machine. In Porta&#8217;s contrivance, too,
we should note particularly the separation of the boiler from
the &#8220;forcing vessel&#8221;&mdash;a plan often claimed as original with
later inventors, and as constituting a fair ground for special
distinction.</p>

<p>The rude engraving (<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>) above is copied from the
book of Porta, and shows plainly the boiler mounted above
a furnace, from the door of which the flame is seen issuing,
and above is the tank containing water. The opening in the
top is closed by the plug, as shown, and the steam issuing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from the boiler into the tank near the top, the water is
driven out through the pipe at the left, leading up from the
bottom of the tank.</p>

<p>Florence Rivault, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Henry IV., and a teacher of Louis XIII., is stated by M.
Arago, the French philosopher, to have discovered, as early
as 1605, that water confined in a bomb-shell and there heated
would explode the shell, however thick its walls might
be made. The fact was published in Rivault&#8217;s treatise on
artillery in 1608. He says: &#8220;The water is converted into
air, and its vaporization is followed by violent explosion.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1615, Salomon de Caus, who had been an engineer
and architect under Louis XIII. of France, and later in the
employ of the English Prince of Wales, published a work
at Frankfort, entitled &#8220;Les Raisons des Forces Mouvantes,
avec diverses machines tant utile que plaisante,&#8221; in which
he illustrated his proposition, &#8220;Water will, by the aid of
fire, mount higher than its source,&#8221; by describing a machine
designed to raise water by the expanding power of steam.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a>
<img src="images/illo042.png" alt="De Caus's Apparatus" width="214" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;De Caus&#8217;s Apparatus, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1605.</p></div>

<p>In the sketch here given (<a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>), and which is copied
from the original in &#8220;Les Raisons des Forces Mouvantes,&#8221;
etc., <i>A</i> is the copper ball containing water; <i>B</i>, the cock at
the extremity of the pipe, taking water from the bottom, <i>C</i>,
of the vessel; <i>D</i>, the cock through which the vessel is filled.
The sketch was probably made by De Caus&#8217;s own hand.</p>

<p>The machine of De Caus, like that of Porta, thus consisted
of a metal vessel partly filled with water, and in which a pipe
was fitted, leading nearly to the bottom, and open at the
top. Fire being applied, the steam formed by its elastic
force drove the water out through the vertical pipe, raising
it to a height limited only by either the desire of the
builder or the strength of the vessel.</p>

<p>In 1629, Giovanni Branca, of the Italian town of Loretto,
described, in a work<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> published at Rome, a number of ingenious
mechanical contrivances, among which was a steam-engine
(<a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>), in which the steam, issuing from a boiler,
impinged upon the vanes of a horizontal wheel. This it
was proposed to apply to many useful purposes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>At this time experiments were in progress in England
which soon resulted in the useful application of steam-power
to raising water.</p>

<p>A patent, dated January 21, 1630, was granted to David

by Charles I., which covered a number of distinct
inventions. These were: &#8220;1. To multiply and make
saltpeter in any open field, in fower acres of ground, sufficient
to serve all our dominions. 2. To raise water from
low pitts by fire. 3. To make any sort of mills to goe on
standing waters by continual motion, without help of wind,
water, or horse. 4. To make all sortes of tapistrie without
any weaving-loom, or waie ever yet in use in this kingdome.
5. To make boats, shippes, and barges to goe against strong
wind and tide. 6. To make the earth more fertile than usual.
7. To raise water from low places and mynes, and coal
pitts, by a new waie never yet in use. 8. To make hard
iron soft, and likewise copper to be tuffe and soft, which is
not in use in this kingdome. 9. To make yellow waxe white
verie speedilie.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seems to have been the first authentic reference to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the use of steam in the arts which has been found in English
literature. The patentee held his grant fourteen years,
on condition of paying an annual fee of &pound;3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the
Crown.</p>

<p>The second claim is distinct as an application of steam,
the language being that which was then, and for a century
and a half subsequently, always employed in speaking
of its use. The steam-engine, in all its forms, was at that
time known as the &#8220;fire-engine.&#8221; It would seem not
at all improbable that the third, fifth, and seventh claims
are also applications of steam-power.</p>

<p>Thomas Grant, in 1632, and Edward Ford, in 1640, also
patented schemes, which have not been described in detail,
for moving ships against wind and tide by some new and
great force.</p>

<p>Dr. John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, an eccentric but
learned and acute scholar, described, in 1648, Cardan&#8217;s
smoke-jack, the earlier &aelig;olipiles, and the power of the confined
steam, and suggested, in a humorous discourse, what
he thought to be perfectly feasible&mdash;the construction of a
flying-machine. He says: &#8220;Might not a &#8216;high pressure&#8217;
be applied with advantage to move wings as large as those
of the &#8216;ruck&#8217;s&#8217; or the &#8216;chariot&#8217;? The engineer might
probably find a corner that would do for a coal-station
near some of the &#8216;castles&#8217;&#8221; (castles in the air). The reverend
wit proposed the application of the smoke-jack to
the chiming of bells, the reeling of yarn, and to rocking
the cradle.</p>

<p>Bishop Wilkins writes, in 1648 (&#8220;Mathematical Magic&#8221;),
of &aelig;olipiles as familiar and useful pieces of apparatus, and
describes them as consisting &#8220;of some such material as may
endure the fire, having a small hole at which they are filled
with water, and out of which (when the vessels are heated)
the air doth issue forth with a strong and lasting violence.&#8221;
&#8220;They are,&#8221; the bishop adds, &#8220;frequently used for the exciting
and contracting of heat in the melting of glasses or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
metals. They may also be contrived to be serviceable for
sundry other pleasant uses, as for the moving of sails in a
chimney-corner, the motion of which sails may be applied
to the turning of a spit, or the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kircher gives an engraving (&#8220;Mundus Subterraneus&#8221;)
showing the last-named application of the &aelig;olipile; and
Erckern (&#8220;Aula Subterranea,&#8221; 1672) gives a picture illustrating
their application to the production of a blast in smelting
ores. They seem to have been frequently used, and in all
parts of Europe, during the seventeenth century, for blowing
fires in houses, as well as in the practical work of the
various trades, and for improving the draft of chimneys.
The latter application is revived very frequently by the
modern inventor.</p>

<p>We next meet with the first instance in which the expansive
force of steam is supposed to have actually been
applied to do important and useful work.</p>

<p>In 1663, Edward Somerset, second Marquis of Worcester,
published a curious collection of descriptions of his inventions,
couched in obscure and singular language, and
called &#8220;A Century of the Names and Scantlings of Inventions
by me already Practised.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Worcester&#8217;s Steam Fountain,
<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1650.</p></div>

<p>One of these inventions is an apparatus for raising water
by steam. The description was not accompanied by a
drawing, but the sketch here given (<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>) is thought
probably to resemble one of his earlier contrivances very
closely.</p>

<p>Steam is generated in the boiler <i>a</i>, and thence is led into
the vessel <i>e</i>, already nearly filled with water, and fitted up
like the apparatus of De Caus. It drives the water in a jet
out through the pipe <i>f</i>. The vessel <i>e</i> is then shut off from
the boiler <i>a</i>, is again filled through the pipe <i>h</i>, and the operation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is repeated. Stuart thinks it possible that the marquis
may have even made an engine with a piston, and
sketches it.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The instruments of Porta and of De Caus
were &#8220;steam fountains,&#8221; and were probably applied, if used
at all, merely to ornamental purposes. That of the <a href="#Port1">Marquis
of Worcester</a> was actually used for the purpose of
elevating water for practical purposes at Vauxhall, near
London.</p>

<img src="images/illo047.png" alt="Worcester" width="350" height="427" />
<p class="caption">Edward Somerset, the Second Marquis of Worcester.</p></div>

<p>How early this invention was introduced at Raglan Castle
by Worcester is not known, but it was probably not
much later than 1628. In 1647 Dircks shows the marquis
probably to have been engaged in getting out parts of the
later engine which was erected at Vauxhall, obtaining his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
materials from William Lambert, a brass-founder. His patent
was issued in June, 1663.</p>

<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1665.</p></div>

<p>We nowhere find an illustrated description of the machine,
or such an account as would enable a mechanic to
reproduce it in all its details. Fortunately, the cells and
grooves (<a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>) remaining in the wall of the citadel of
Raglan Castle indicate the general dimensions and arrangement
of the engine; and Dircks, the biographer of the inventor,
has suggested the form of apparatus shown in the
sketch (<a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>) as most perfectly in accord with the evidence
there found, and with the written specifications.</p>

<p>The two vessels, <i>A A&#8242;</i>, are connected by a steam-pipe,
<i>B B&#8242;</i>, with the boiler, <i>C</i>, behind them. <i>D</i> is the furnace.
A vertical water-pipe, <i>E</i>, is connected with the cold-water
vessels, <i>A A&#8242;</i>, by the pipes, <i>F F&#8242;</i>, reaching nearly to
the bottom. Water is supplied by the pipes, <i>G G&#8242;</i>, with
valves, <i>a a&#8242;</i>, dipping into the well or ditch, <i>H</i>. Steam from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the boiler being admitted to each vessel, <i>A</i> and <i>A&#8242;</i>, alternately,
and there condensing, the vacuum formed permits
the pressure of the atmosphere to force the water
from the well through the pipes, <i>G</i> and <i>G&#8242;</i>. While one is
filling, the steam is forcing the charge of water from the
other up the discharge-pipe, <i>E</i>. As soon as each is emptied,
the steam is shut off from it and turned into the other, and
the condensation of the steam remaining in the vessel permits
it to fill again. As will be seen presently, this is substantially,
and almost precisely, the form of engine of which
the invention is usually attributed to Savery, a later inventor.</p>

<p>Worcester never succeeded in forming the great company
which he hoped would introduce his invention on a
scale commensurate with its importance, and his fate was
that of nearly all inventors. He died poor and unsuccessful.</p>

<p>His widow, who lived until 1681, seemed to have become
as confident as was Worcester himself that the invention
had value, and, long after his death, was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> endeavoring
to secure its introduction, but with equal non-success.
The steam-engine had taken a form which made it
inconceivably valuable to the world, at a time when no more
efficient means of raising water was available at the most
valuable mines than horse-power; but the people, greatly as
it was needed, were not yet sufficiently intelligent to avail
themselves of the great boon, the acceptance of which was
urged upon them with all the persistence and earnestness
which characterizes every true inventor.</p>

<p>Worcester is described by his biographer as having been
a learned, thoughtful, studious, and good man&mdash;a Romanist
without prejudice or bigotry, a loyal subject, free from partisan
intolerance; as a public man, upright, honorable, and
humane; as a scholar, learned without being pedantic; as
a mechanic, patient, skillful, persevering, and of wonderful
ingenuity, and of clear, almost intuitive, apprehension.</p>

<p>Yet, with all these natural advantages, reinforced as they
were by immense wealth and influence in his earlier life,
and by hardly lessened social and political influence when
a large fortune had been spent in experiment, and after misfortune
had subdued his spirits and left him without money
or a home, the inventor failed to secure the introduction of
a device which was needed more than any other. Worcester
had attained practical success; but the period of speculation
was but just closing, and that of the application of
steam had not quite yet arrived.</p>

<p>The second Marquis of Worcester stands on the record
as the first steam-engine builder, and his death marks the
termination of the first of those periods into which we have
divided the history of the growth of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>The &#8220;water-commanding engine,&#8221; as its inventor called
it, was the first instance in the history of the steam-engine in
which the inventor is known to have &#8220;reduced his invention
to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that the invention of the separate
boiler, important as it was, had been anticipated by Porta,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and does not entitle the marquis to the honor, claimed for
him by many English authorities, of being <i>the</i> inventor of
the steam-engine. Somerset was simply <i>one</i> of those whose
works collectively made the steam-engine.</p>

<p>After the time of Worcester, we enter upon a stage of
history which may properly be termed a period of application;
and from this time forward steam continued to play
a more and more important part in social economy, and its
influence on the welfare of mankind augmented with a rapidly-increasing
growth.</p>

<p>The knowledge then existing of the immense expansive
force of steam, and the belief that it was destined to submit
to the control of man and to lend its immense power in
every department of industry, were evidently not confined to
any one nation. From Italy to Northern Germany, and
from France to Great Britain, the distances, measured in
time, were vastly greater then than now, when this wonderful
genius has helped us to reduce weeks to hours;
but there existed, notwithstanding, a very perfect system
of communication, and the learning of every centre was
promptly radiated to every other. It thus happened that,
at this time, the speculative study of the steam-engine was
confined to no part of Europe; inventors and experimenters
were busy everywhere developing this promising scheme.</p>

<p>Jean Hautefeuille, the son of a French <i>boulanger</i>, born
at Orleans, adopted by the Duchess of Bouillon at the suggestion
of De Sourdis, profiting by the great opportunities
offered him, entered the Church, and became one of the
most learned men and greatest mechanicians of his time.
He studied the many schemes then brought forward by inventors
with the greatest interest, and was himself prolific
of new ideas.</p>

<p>In 1678, he proposed the use of alcohol in an engine,
&#8220;in such a manner that the liquid should evaporate and be
condensed, <i>tour &agrave; tour</i>, without being wasted&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
recorded plan, probably, for surface-condensation and complete
retention of the working-fluid. He proposed a gunpowder-engine,
of which<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
he described three varieties.</p>

<p>In one of these engines he displaced the atmosphere by
the gases produced by the explosion, and the vacuum thus
obtained was utilized in raising water by the pressure of the
air. In the second machine, the pressure of the gases
evolved by the combustion of the powder acted directly
upon the water, forcing it upward; and in the third design,
the pressure of the vapor drove a piston, and this engine
was described as fitted to supply power for many purposes.
There is no evidence that he constructed these machines,
however, and they are here referred to simply as indicating
that all the elements of the machine were becoming well
known, and that an ingenious mechanic, combining known
devices, could at this time have produced the steam-engine.
Its early appearance should evidently have been
anticipated.</p>

<p>Hautefeuille, if we may judge from evidence at hand,
was the first to propose the use of a piston in a heat-engine,
and his gunpowder-engine seems to have been the first machine
which would be called a heat-engine by the modern
mechanic. The earlier &#8220;machines&#8221; or &#8220;engines,&#8221; including
that of Hero and those of the Marquis of Worcester, would
rather be denominated &#8220;apparatus,&#8221; as that term is used by
the physicist or the chemist, than a machine or an engine,
as the terms are used by the engineer.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig10" id="Fig10"></a>
<img src="images/illo053.png" alt="Huyghens's Engine" width="96" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;<br />Huyghens&#8217;s<br />Engine,<br />1680.</p></div>

<p>Huyghens, in 1680, in a memoir presented to the Academy
of Sciences, speaks of the expansive force of gunpowder
as capable of utilization as a convenient and portable
mechanical power, and indicates that he had designed a
machine in which it could be applied.</p>

<p>This machine of Huyghens is of great interest, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> simply
because it was the first gas-engine and the prototype of
the very successful modern explosive gas-engine
of Otto and Langen, but principally as
having been the first engine which consisted of
a cylinder and piston. The <a href="#Fig10">sketch</a> shows its
form. It consisted of a cylinder, <i>A</i>, a piston,
<i>B</i>, two relief-pipes, <i>C C</i>, fitted with check-valves
and a system of pulleys, <i>F</i>, by which the
weight is raised. The explosion of the powder
at <i>H</i> expels the air from the cylinder. When
the products of combustion have cooled, the
pressure of the atmosphere is no longer counterbalanced
by that of air beneath, and the piston
is forced down, raising the weight. The plan
was never put in practice, although the invention
was capable of being made a working and
possibly useful machine.</p>

<p>At about this period the English attained
some superiority over their neighbors on the
Continent in the practical application of science
and the development of the useful arts, and it has never since
been lost. A sudden and great development of applied science
and of the useful arts took place during the reign of Charles
II., which is probably largely attributable to the interest
taken by that monarch in many branches of construction and
of science. He is said to have been very fond of mathematics,
mechanics, chemistry, and natural history, and to have had
a laboratory erected, and to have employed learned men to
carry on experiments and lines of research for his satisfaction.
He was especially fond of the study and investigation
of the arts and sciences most closely related to naval
architecture and navigation, and devoted much attention to
the determination of the best forms of vessels, and to the
discovery of the best kinds of ship-timber. His brother,
the Duke of York, was equally fond of this study, and was
his companion in some of his work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Great as is the influence of the monarch, to-day, in forming
the tastes and habits and in determining the direction
of the studies and labors of the people, his influence was
vastly more potent in those earlier days; and it may well
be believed that the rapid strides taken by Great Britain
from that time were, in great degree, a consequence of the
well-known habits of Charles II., and that the nation, which
had an exceptional natural aptitude for mechanical pursuits,
should have been prompted by the example of its king
to enter upon such a course as resulted in the early attainment
of an advanced position in all branches of applied
science.</p>

<p>The appointment, under Sir Robert Moray, the superintendent
of the laboratory of the king, of Master Mechanic,
was conferred upon Sir Samuel Morland, a nobleman who,
in his practical knowledge of mechanics and in his ingenuity
and fruitfulness of invention, was apparently almost equal
to Worcester. He was the son of a Berkshire clergyman,
was educated at Cambridge, where he studied mathematics
with great interest, and entered public life soon after. He
served the Parliament under Cromwell, and afterward went
to Geneva. He was of a decidedly literary turn of mind,
and wrote a history of the Piedmont churches, which gave
him great repute with the Protestant party. He was induced
subsequently, on the accession of Charles II., to take
service under that monarch, whose gratitude he had earned
by revealing a plot for his assassination.</p>

<p>He received his appointment and a baronetcy in 1660, and
immediately commenced making experiments, partly at his
own expense and partly at the cost of the royal exchequer,
which were usually not at all remunerative. He built hand
fire-engines of various kinds, taking patents on them, which
brought him as small profits as did his work for the king,
and invented the speaking-trumpet, calculating machines,
and a capstan. His house at Vauxhall was full of curious
devices, the products of his own ingenuity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>He devoted much attention to apparatus for raising
water. His devices seem to have usually been modifications
of the now familiar force-pump. They attracted much attention,
and exhibitions were made of them before the king
and queen and the court. He was sent to France on business
relating to water-works erected for King Charles, and
while in Paris he constructed pumps and pumping apparatus
for the satisfaction of Louis XIV. In his book,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> published
in Paris in 1683, and presented to the king, and an
earlier manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> still preserved in the British Museum,
Morland shows a perfect familiarity with the power of
steam. He says, in the latter: &#8220;Water being evaporated
by fire, the vapors require a greater space (about two thousand
times) than that occupied by the water; and, rather
than submit to imprisonment, it will burst a piece of ordnance.
But, being controlled according to the laws of
statics, and, by science, reduced to the measure of weight
and balance, it bears its burden peaceably (like good horses),
and thus may be of great use to mankind, especially for the
raising of water, according to the following table, which
indicates the number of pounds which may be raised six
inches, 1,800 times an hour, by cylinders half-filled with
water, and of the several diameters and depths of said cylinders.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then gives the following table, a comparison of
which with modern tables proves Morland to have acquired
a very considerable and tolerably accurate knowledge of
the volume and pressure of saturated steam:</p>

<p>The rate of enlargement of volume in the conversion of
water into steam, as given in Morland&#8217;s book, appears remarkably
accurate when compared with statements made
by other early experimenters. Desaguliers gave the ratio
of volumes at 14,000, and this was accepted as correct for
many years, and until Watt&#8217;s experiments, which were
quoted by Dr. Robison as giving the ratio at between
1,800 and 1,900. Morland also states the &#8220;duty&#8221; of his
engines in the same manner in which it is stated by engineers
to-day.</p>

<p>Morland must undoubtedly have been acquainted with
the work of his distinguished contemporary, Lord Worcester,
and his apparatus seems most likely to have been a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
modification&mdash;perhaps improvement&mdash;of Worcester&#8217;s engine. His
house was at Vauxhall, and the establishment set up for the
king was in the neighborhood. It may be that Morland is
to be credited with greater success in the introduction of
his predecessor&#8217;s apparatus than the inventor himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Hutton considered this book to have been the earliest
account of the steam-engine, and accepts the date&mdash;1682&mdash;as
that of the invention, and adds, that &#8220;the project
seems to have remained obscure in both countries till 1699,
when Savery, who probably knew more of Morland&#8217;s invention
than he owned, obtained a patent,&#8221; etc. We have,
however, scarcely more complete or accurate knowledge of
the extent of Morland&#8217;s work, and of its real value, than of
that of Worcester. Morland died in 1696, at Hammersmith,
not far from London, and his body lies in Fulham church.</p>

<p>From this time forward the minds of many mechanicians
were earnestly at work on this problem&mdash;the raising
of water by aid of steam. Hitherto, although many ingenious
toys, embodying the principles of the steam-engine
separately, and sometimes to a certain extent collectively,
had been proposed, and even occasionally constructed, the
world was only just ready to profit by the labors of inventors
in this direction.</p>

<p>But, at the end of the seventeenth century, English
miners were beginning to find the greatest difficulty in
clearing their shafts of the vast quantities of water which
they were meeting at the considerable depths to which they
had penetrated, and it had become a matter of vital importance
to them to find a more powerful aid in that work
than was then available. They were, therefore, by their
necessities stimulated to watch for, and to be prepared
promptly to take advantage of, such an invention when it
should be offered them.</p>

<p>The experiments of Papin, and the practical application
of known principles by Savery, placed the needed apparatus
in their hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Port2">Thomas Savery</a></span> was a member of a well-known family
of Devonshire, England, and was born at Shilston, about
1650. He was well educated, and became a military engineer.
He exhibited great fondness for mechanics, and for
mathematics and natural philosophy, and gave much time
to experimenting, to the contriving of various kinds of
apparatus, and to invention. He constructed a clock, which
still remains in the family, and is considered an ingenious
piece of mechanism, and is said to be of excellent workmanship.</p>

<p>He invented and patented an arrangement of paddle-wheels,
driven by a capstan<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
for propelling vessels in calm
weather, and spent some time endeavoring to secure its
adoption by the British Admiralty and the Navy Board,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
but met with no success. The principal objector was the
Surveyor of the Navy, who dismissed Savery, with a remark
which illustrates a spirit which, although not yet extinct, is
less frequently met with in the public service now than
then: &#8220;What have interloping people, that have no concern
with us, to do to pretend to contrive or invent things
for us?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Savery then fitted his apparatus into a small
vessel, and exhibited its operation on the Thames. The
invention was never introduced into the navy, however.</p>

<p>It was after this time that Savery became the inventor of
a steam-engine. It is not known whether he was familiar
with the work of Worcester, and of earlier inventors. Desaguliers<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
states that he had read the book of Worcester, and
that he subsequently endeavored to destroy all evidence of
the anticipation of his own invention by the marquis by buying
up all copies of the century that he could find, and burning
them. The story is scarcely credible. A comparison of
the drawings given of the two engines exhibits, nevertheless,
a striking resemblance; and, assuming that of the marquis&#8217;s
engine to be correct, Savery is to be given credit for
the finally successful introduction of the &#8220;semi-omnipotent&#8221;
&#8220;water-commanding&#8221; engine of Worcester.</p>

<p>The most important advance in actual construction,
therefore, was made by Thomas Savery. The constant and
embarrassing expense, and the engineering difficulties presented
by the necessity of keeping the British mines, and
particularly the deep pits of Cornwall, free from water, and
the failure of every attempt previously made to provide
effective and economical pumping-machinery, were noted by
Savery, who, July 25, 1698, patented the design of the first
engine which was ever actually employed in this work. A
working-model was submitted to the Royal Society of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> London
in 1699, and successful experiments were made with it.
Savery spent a considerable time in planning his engine and
in perfecting it, and states that he expended large sums of
money upon it.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig11" id="Fig11"></a>
<img src="images/illo061.png" alt="Savery's Model" width="248" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Savery&#8217;s Model, 1698.</p></div>

<p>Having finally succeeded in satisfying himself with its
operation, he exhibited a model &#8220;Fire-Engine,&#8221; as it was
called in those days, before King William III. and his court,
at Hampton Court, in 1698, and obtained his patent without
delay. The title of the patent reads: &#8220;A grant to
Thomas Savery, Gentl., of the sole exercise of a new invention
by him invented, for raising of water, and occasioning
motion to all sorts of mill-works, by the impellant force of
fire, which will be of great use for draining mines, serving
towns with water, and for the working of all sorts of mills,
when they have not the benefit of water nor constant winds;
to hold for 14 years; with usual clauses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Savery now went about the work of introducing his invention
in a way which is in marked contrast with that
usually adopted by the inventors of that time. He commenced
a systematic and successful system of advertisement,
and lost no opportunity of making his plans not
merely known, but well understood, even in matters of detail.
The Royal Society was then fully organized, and at one
of its meetings he obtained permission to appear with his
model &#8220;fire-engine&#8221; and to explain its operation; and, as
the minutes read, &#8220;Mr. Savery entertained the Society with
showing his engine to raise water by the force of fire. He
was thanked for showing the experiment, which succeeded,
according to expectation, and was approved of.&#8221; He presented
to the Society a drawing and specifications of his
machine, and &#8220;The Transactions&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> contain a <a href="#Fig11">copperplate
engraving</a> and the description of his model. It consisted of
a furnace, <i>A</i>, heating a boiler, <i>B</i>, which was connected by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
pipes, <i>C C</i>, with two copper receivers, <i>D D</i>. There were
led from the bottom of these receivers branch pipes, <i>F F</i>,
which turned upward, and were united to form a rising
main, or &#8220;forcing-pipe,&#8221; <i>G</i>.
From the top of each receiver
was led a pipe, which was turned
downward, and these pipes united
to form a suction-pipe, which
was led down to the bottom of
the well or reservoir from which
the water was to be drawn. The
maximum lift allowable was
stated at 24 feet.</p>

<p>The engine was worked as
follows: Steam is raised in the
boiler, <i>B</i>, and a cock, <i>C</i>, being
opened, a receiver, <i>D</i>, is filled
with steam. Closing the cock,
<i>C</i>, the steam condensing in the
receiver, a vacuum is created, and the pressure of the atmosphere
forces the water up, through the supply-pipe,
from the well into the receiver. Opening the cock, <i>C</i>, again,
the check-valve in the suction-pipe at <i>E</i> closes, the steam
drives the water out through the forcing-pipe, <i>G</i>, the clack-valve,
<i>E</i>, on that pipe opening before it, and the liquid is
expelled from the top of the pipe. The valve, <i>C</i>, is again
closed; the steam again condenses, and the engine is worked
as before. While one of the two receivers is discharging,
the other is filling, as in the machine of the Marquis of
Worcester, and thus the steam is drawn from the boiler
with tolerable regularity, and the expulsion of water takes
place with similar uniformity, the two systems of receivers
and pipes being worked alternately by the single boiler.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig12" id="Fig12"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Savery&#8217;s Engine, 1698.</p></div>

<p>In another and still simpler little machine,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
erected at Kensington (<a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>), the same general plan
was adopted, combining a suction-pipe, <i>A</i>, 16 feet long
and 3 inches in diameter; a single receiver, <i>B</i>, capable
of containing 13 gallons; a boiler, <i>C</i>, of about 40 gallons
capacity; a forcing-pipe, <i>D</i>, 42 feet high, with the connecting
pipe and cocks, <i>E F G</i>; and the method of
operation was as already described, except that <i>surface-condensation</i>
was employed, the cock, <i>F</i>, being arranged
to shower water from the rising main over the receiver,
as shown. Of the first engine Switzer says: &#8220;I have
heard him say myself, that the very first time he played,
it was in a potter&#8217;s house at Lambeth, where, though it was
a small engine, yet it (the water) forced its way through
the roof, and struck off the tiles in a manner that surprised
all the spectators.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Kensington engine cost &pound;50, and raised 3,000 gallons
per hour, filling the receiver four times a minute, and
required a bushel of coal per day. Switzer remarks: &#8220;It
must be noted that this engine is but a small one in comparison
with many others that are made for coal-works;
but this is sufficient for any reasonable family, and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
uses required of it in watering all middling gardens.&#8221; He
cautions the operator: &#8220;When you have raised water
enough, and you design to leave off working the engine,
take away all the fire from under the boiler, and open the
cock (connected to the funnel) to let out the steam, which
would otherwise, were it to remain confined, perhaps burst
the engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the intention of making his invention more generally
known, and hoping to introduce it as a pumping-engine
in the mining districts of Cornwall, Savery wrote a prospectus
for general circulation, which contains the earliest
account of the later and more effective form of engine. He
entitled his pamphlet &#8220;The Miner&#8217;s Friend; or, A Description
of an Engine to raise Water by Fire described, and the
Manner of fixing it in Mines, with an Account of the several
Uses it is applicable to, and an Answer to the Objections
against it.&#8221; It was printed in London in 1702, for
S. Crouch, and was distributed among the proprietors and
managers of mines, who were then finding the flow of water
at depths so great as, in some cases, to bar further progress.
In many cases, the cost of drainage left no satisfactory margin
of profit. In one mine, 500 horses were employed raising
water, by the then usual method of using horse-gins
and buckets.</p>

<p>The approval of the King and of the Royal Society, and
the countenance of the mine-adventurers of England, were
acknowledged by the author, who addressed his pamphlet to
them.</p>

<p>The engraving of the engine was reproduced, with the
description, in Harris&#8217;s &#8220;Lexicon Technicum,&#8221; 1704; in
Switzer&#8217;s &#8220;Hydrostatics,&#8221; 1729; and in Desaguliers&#8217;s &#8220;Experimental
Philosophy,&#8221; 1744.</p>

<p>The sketch which here follows is a neater engraving of
the same machine. Savery&#8217;s engine is shown in <a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>,
as described by Savery himself, in 1702, in &#8220;The Miner&#8217;s
Friend.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span><i>L</i> is the boiler in which steam is raised, and through
the pipes <i>O O</i> it is alternately let into the vessels <i>P P</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose it to pass into the left-hand vessel first. The
valve <i>M</i> being closed, and <i>R</i> being opened, the water contained
in <i>P</i> is driven out and up the pipe <i>S</i> to the desired
height, where it is discharged.</p>

<p>The valve <i>R</i> is then closed, and the valve in the pipe <i>O</i>;
the valve <i>M</i> is next opened, and condensing water is turned
upon the exterior of <i>P</i> by the cock <i>Y</i>, leading water from
the cistern <i>X</i>. As the steam contained in <i>P</i> is condensed,
forming a vacuum there, a fresh charge of water is driven
by atmospheric pressure up the pipe <i>T</i>.</p>

<p>Meantime, steam from the boiler has been let into the
right-hand vessel <i>P</i>, the cock <i>W</i> having been first closed,
and <i>R</i> opened.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>The charge of water is driven out through the lower
pipe and the cock <i>R</i>, and up the pipe <i>S</i> as before, while the
other vessel is refilling preparatory to acting in its turn.</p>

<p>The two vessels are thus alternately charged and discharged,
as long as is necessary.</p>

<p>Savery&#8217;s method of supplying his boiler with water was
at once simple and ingenious.</p>

<p>The small boiler, <i>D</i>, is filled with water from any convenient
source, as from the stand-pipe, <i>S</i>. A fire is then
built under it, and, when the pressure of steam in <i>D</i> becomes
greater than in the main boiler, <i>L</i>, a communication
is opened between their lower ends, and the water passes,
under pressure, from the smaller to the larger boiler, which
is thus &#8220;fed&#8221; without interrupting the work. <i>G</i> and <i>N</i>
are <i>gauge-cocks</i>, by which the height of water in the boilers
is determined; they were first adopted by Savery.</p>

<p>Here we find, therefore, the first really practicable and
commercially valuable steam-engine. Thomas Savery is
entitled to the credit of having been the first to introduce a
machine in which the power of heat, acting through the
medium of steam, was rendered generally useful.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Savery, like the Marquis of
Worcester, used a boiler separate from the water-reservoir.</p>

<p>He added to the &#8220;water-commanding engine&#8221; of the
marquis the system of <i>surface-condensation</i>, by which he
was enabled to charge his vessels when it became necessary
to refill them; and added, also, the secondary boiler, which
enabled him to supply the working-boiler with water without
interrupting its work.</p>

<p>The machine was thus made capable of working uninterruptedly
for a period of time only limited by its own decay.</p>

<p>Savery never fitted his boilers with safety-valves, although
it was done earlier by Papin; and in deep mines
he was compelled to make use of higher pressures than his
rudely-constructed boilers could safely bear.</p>

<p>Savery&#8217;s engine was used at a number of mines, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
also for supplying water to towns; some large estates,
country houses, and other private establishments, employed
them for the same purpose. They did not, however, come
into general use among the mines, because, according to
Desaguliers, they were apprehensive of danger from the
explosion of the boilers or receivers. As Desaguliers wrote
subsequently: &#8220;Savery made a great many experiments
to bring this machine to perfection, and did erect several
which raised water very well for gentlemen&#8217;s seats, but
could not succeed for mines, or supplying towns, where the
water was to be raised very high and in great quantities;
for then the steam required being boiled up to such a
strength as to be ready to tear all the vessels to pieces.&#8221;
&#8220;I have known Captain Savery, at York&#8217;s buildings, to
make steam eight or ten times stronger than common air;
and then its heat was so great that it would melt common
soft solder, and its strength so great as to blow open several
joints of the machine; so that he was forced to be at the
pains and charge to have all his joints soldered with spelter
or hard solder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although there were other difficulties in the application
of the Savery engine to many kinds of work, this was the
most serious one, and explosions did occur with fatal results.
The writer just quoted relates, in his &#8220;Experimental
Philosophy,&#8221; that a man who was ignorant of the nature
of the engine undertook to work a machine which Desaguliers
had provided with a safety-valve to avoid this very
danger, &#8220;and, having hung the weight at the further end of
the steelyard, in order to collect more steam in order to
make his work the quicker, he hung also a very heavy
plumber&#8217;s iron upon the end of the steelyard; the consequence
proved fatal; for, after some time, the steam, not
being able, with the safety-cock, to raise up the steelyard
loaded with all this unusual weight, burst the boiler with a
great explosion, and killed the poor man.&#8221; This is probably
the earliest record of a steam-boiler explosion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Savery proposed to use his engine for driving mills; but
there is no evidence that he actually made such an application
of the machine, although it was afterward so applied by
others. The engine was not well adapted to the drainage of
surface-land, as the elevation of large quantities of water
through small heights required great capacity of receivers,
or compelled the use of several engines for each case. The
filling of the receivers, in such cases, also compelled the
heating of large areas of cold and wet metallic surfaces by
the steam at each operation, and thus made the work comparatively
wasteful of fuel. Where used in mines, they
were necessarily placed within 30 feet or less of the lowest
level, and were therefore exposed to danger of submergence
whenever, by any accident, the water should rise above
that level. In many cases this would result in the loss of
the engine, and the mine would remain &#8220;drowned,&#8221; unless
another engine should be procured to pump it out. Where
the mine was deep, the water was forced by the pressure
of steam from the level of the engine-station to the top of
the lift. This compelled the use of pressures of several
atmospheres in many cases; and a pressure of three atmospheres,
or about 45 pounds per square inch, was considered,
in those days, as about the maximum pressure allowable.
This difficulty was met by setting a separate engine
at every 60 or 80 feet, and pumping the water from one to
the other. If any one engine in the set became disabled,
the pumping was interrupted until that one machine could
be repaired. The size of Savery&#8217;s largest boilers was not
great, their maximum diameter not exceeding two and a
half feet. This made it necessary to provide several of his
engines, usually, for a single mine, and at each level. The
first cost and the expense of repairs were exceedingly serious
items. The expense and danger, either real or apparent,
were thus sufficient to deter many from their use, and
the old method of raising water by horse-power was adhered
to.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The consumption of fuel with these engines was very
great. The steam was not generated economically, as the
boilers used were of such simple forms as only could then
be produced, and presented too little heating surface to secure
a very complete transfer of heat from the gases of
combustion to the water within the boiler. This waste in
the generation of steam in these uneconomical boilers was
followed by still more serious waste in its application, without
expansion, to the expulsion of water from a metallic
receiver, the cold and wet sides of which absorbed heat
with the greatest avidity. The great mass of the liquid was
not, however, heated by the steam, and was expelled at the
temperature at which it was raised from below.</p>

<p>Savery quaintly relates the action of his machine in &#8220;The
Miner&#8217;s Friend,&#8221; and so exactly, that a better description
could scarcely be asked: &#8220;The steam acts upon the surface
of the water in the receiver, which surface only being heated
by the steam, it does not condense, but the steam gravitates
or presses with an elastic quality like air, and still increasing
its elasticity or spring, until it counterpoises, or rather exceeds,
the weight of the column of water in the force-pipe,
which then it will necessarily drive up that pipe; the steam
then takes some time to recover its power, but it will at last
discharge the water out at the top of the pipe. You may
see on the outside of the receiver how the water goes out,
as well as if it were transparent; for, so far as the steam is
contained within the vessel, it is dry without, and so hot as
scarcely to endure the least touch of the hand; but so far
as the water is inside the vessel, it will be cold and wet on
the outside, where any water has fallen on it; which cold
and moisture vanish as fast as the steam takes the place of
the water in its descent.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Savery&#8217;s death, in 1716, several of these engines
were erected in which some improvements were introduced.
Dr. Desaguliers, in 1718, built a Savery engine, in which he
avoided some defects which he, with Dr. Gravesande, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
noted two years earlier. They had then proposed to adopt
the arrangement of a single receiver which had been used
by Savery himself, as already described, finding, by experiment
on a model which they had made for the purpose,
that one could be discharged three times, while the same
boiler would empty two receivers but once each. In their
arrangement, the steam was shut back in the boiler while
the receiver was filling with water, and a high pressure thus
accumulated, instead of being turned into the second receiver,
and the pressure thus kept comparatively low.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig14" id="Fig14"></a>
<img src="images/illo069.png" alt="Papin's Two-Way Cock" width="350" height="280" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Papin&#8217;s Two-Way Cock.</p></div>

<p>In the engine built in 1718, Desaguliers used a spherical
boiler, which he provided with the lever safety-valve already
applied by Papin, and adopted a comparatively small receiver&mdash;one-fifth
the capacity of the boiler&mdash;of slender cylindrical
form, and attached a pipe leading the water for
condensation into the vessel, and effected its distribution by
means of the &#8220;rose,&#8221; or a &#8220;sprinkling-plate,&#8221; such as is still
frequently used in modern engines having jet-condensers.
This substitution of jet for surface-condensation was of
very great advantage, securing great promptness in the
formation of a vacuum and a rapid filling of the receiver.
A &#8220;<a href="#Fig14">two-way cock</a>&#8221; admitted steam to the receiver, or,
being turned the other way, admitted the cold condensing
water. The dispersion of the water in minute streams or
drops was a very important detail, not only as securing great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
rapidity of condensation, but enabling the designer to employ
a comparatively small receiver or condenser.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Engine built by
Desaguliers in 1718.</p></div>

<p>The engine is shown in <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>, which is copied from the
&#8220;Experimental Philosophy&#8221; of Desaguliers.</p>

<p>The receiver, <i>A</i>, is connected to the boiler, <i>B</i>, by a
steam-pipe, <i>C</i>, terminating at the two-way cock, <i>D</i>; the
&#8220;forcing-pipe,&#8221; <i>E</i>, has at its foot a check-valve, <i>F</i>, and the
valve <i>G</i> is a similar check at the head of the suction-pipe.
<i>H</i> is a strainer, to prevent the ingress of chips or other
bodies carried to the pipe by the current; the cap above the
valves is secured by a bridle, or stirrup, and screw, <i>I</i>, and
may be readily removed to clear the valves or to renew
them; <i>K</i> is the handle of the two-way cock; <i>M</i> is the injection-cock,
and is kept open during the working of the
engine; <i>L</i> is the chimney-flue; <i>N</i> and <i>O</i> are gauge-cocks
fitted to pipes leading to the proper depths within the boiler,
the water-line being somewhere between the levels of their
lower ends; <i>P</i> is a lever safety-valve, as first used on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
&#8220;Digester&#8221; of Papin; <i>R</i> is the reservoir into which the
water is pumped; <i>T</i> is the flue, leading spirally about the
boiler from the furnace, <i>V</i>, to the chimney; <i>Y</i> is a cock
fitted in a pipe through which the rising-main may be filled
from the reservoir, should injection-water be needed when
that pipe is empty.</p>

<p>Seven of these engines were built, the first of which
was made for the Czar of Russia. Its boiler had a capacity
of &#8220;five or six hogsheads,&#8221; and the receiver, &#8220;holding one
hogshead,&#8221; was filled and emptied four times a minute.
The water was raised &#8220;by suction&#8221; 29 feet, and forced by
steam pressure 11 feet higher.</p>

<p>Another engine built at about this time, to raise water
29 feet &#8220;by suction,&#8221; and to force it 24 feet higher, made
6 &#8220;strokes&#8221; per minute, and, when forcing water but 6 or
8 feet, made 8 or 9 strokes per minute. Twenty-five years
later a workman overloaded the safety-valve of this engine,
by placing the weight at the end and then adding &#8220;a very
heavy plumber&#8217;s iron.&#8221; The boiler exploded, killing the
attendant.</p>

<p>Desaguliers says that one of these engines, capable of
raising ten tons an hour 38 feet, in 1728 or 1729, cost &pound;80,
exclusive of the piping.</p>

<p>Blakely, in 1766, patented an improved Savery engine,
in which he endeavored to avoid the serious loss due to condensation
of the steam by direct contact with the water, by
interposing a cushion of oil, which floated upon the water
and prevented the contact of the steam with the surface of
the water beneath it. He also used air for the same purpose,
sometimes in double receivers, one supported on the
other. These plans did not, however, prove satisfactory.</p>

<p>Rigley, of Manchester, England, soon after erected
Savery engines, and applied them to the driving of mills,
by pumping water into reservoirs, from whence it returned
to the wells or ponds from which it had been raised, turning
water-wheels as it descended.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Such an arrangement was in operation many years at
the works of a Mr. Kiers, St. Pancras, London. It is described
in detail, and illustrated, in Nicholson&#8217;s &#8220;Philosophical
Journal,&#8221; vol. i., p. 419. It had a &#8220;wagon-boiler&#8221;
7 feet long, 5 wide, and 5 deep; the wheel was
18 feet in diameter, and drove the lathes and other
machinery of the works. In this engine Blakely&#8217;s plan
of injecting air was adopted. The injection-valve was
a clack, which closed automatically when the vacuum was
formed.</p>

<p>The engine consumed 6 or 7 bushels of good coals, and
made 10 strokes per minute, raising 70 cubic feet of water
14 feet, and developing nearly 3 horse-power.</p>

<p>Many years after Savery&#8217;s death, in 1774, Smeaton made
the first duty-trials of engines of this kind. He found that
an engine having a cylindrical receiver 16 inches in diameter
and 22 feet high, discharging the water raised 14 feet above
the surface of the water in the well, making 12 strokes, and
raising 100 cubic feet per minute, developed 2<span class="enum">2</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">3</span> horse-power,
and consumed 3 hundredweight of coals in four
hours. Its duty was, therefore, 5,250,000 pounds raised one
foot per bushel of 84 pounds of coals, or 62,500 &#8220;foot-pounds&#8221;
of work per pound of fuel. An engine of slightly
greater size gave a duty about 5 per cent. greater.</p>

<p>When Louis XIV. revoked the edict of Nantes, by
which Henry IV. had guaranteed protection to the Protestants
of France, the terrible persecutions at once commenced
drove from the kingdom some of its greatest men. Among
these was Denys Papin.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that the influence of the atmospheric
pressure on the boiling-point began to be observed,
Dr. Hooke having found that the boiling-point was
a fixed temperature under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere,
and the increase in temperature and pressure of
steam when confined having been shown by Papin with his
&#8220;Digester.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption">Denys Papin.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Port3">Denys Papin</a></span> was of a family which had attached itself
to the Protestant Church; but he was given his education
in the school of the Jesuits at Blois, and there acquired his
knowledge of mathematics. His medical education was
given him at Paris, although he probably received his degree
at Orleans. He settled in Paris in 1672, with the
intention of practising his profession, and devoted all his
spare time, apparently, to the study of physics.</p>

<p>Meantime, that distinguished philosopher, Huyghens,
the inventor of the clock and of the gunpowder-engine, had
been induced by the linen-draper&#8217;s apprentice, Colbert, now
the most trusted adviser of the king, to take up his residence
in Paris, and had been made one of the earliest members
of the Academy of Science, which was founded at
about that time. Papin became an assistant to Huyghens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and aided him in his experiments in mechanics, having
been introduced by Madame Colbert, who was also a native
of Blois. Here he devised several modifications of the instruments
of Guericke, and printed a description of them.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
This little book was presented to the Academy, and very
favorably noticed. Papin now became well known among
contemporary men of science at Paris, and was well received
everywhere. Soon after, in the year 1675, as stated
by the <i>Journal des Savants</i>, he left Paris and took up his
residence in England, where he very soon made the acquaintance
of Robert Boyle, the founder, and of the members
of the Royal Society. Boyle speaks of Papin as having
gone to England in the hope of finding a place in which he
could satisfactorily pursue his favorite studies.</p>

<p>Boyle himself had already been long engaged in the
study of pneumatics, and had been especially interested in
the investigations which had been original with Guericke.
He admitted young Papin into his laboratory, and the
two philosophers worked together at these attractive problems.
It was while working with Boyle that Papin invented
the double air-pump and the air-gun.</p>

<p>Papin and his work had now become so well known,
and he had attained so high a position in science, that he
was nominated for membership in the Royal Academy, and
was elected December 16, 1680. He at once took his place
among the most talented and distinguished of the great
men of his time.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig16" id="Fig16"></a>
<img src="images/illo075.png" alt="Digester" width="350" height="415" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Papin&#8217;s Digester, 1680.</p></div>

<p>He probably invented his &#8220;Digester&#8221; while in England,
and it was first described in a brochure written in English,
under the title, &#8220;The New Digester.&#8221; It was subsequently
published in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
This was a vessel, <i>B</i> (<a href="#Fig16">Fig. 16</a>), capable
of being tightly closed by a screw, <i>D</i>, and a lid, <i>C</i>, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which food could be cooked in water raised by a furnace,
<i>A</i>, to the temperature due to any desired safe pressure of
steam. The pressure was determined and limited by a
weight, <i>W</i>, on the safety-valve lever, <i>G</i>. It is probable that
this essential attachment to the steam-boiler had previously
been used for other purposes; but Papin is given the
credit of having first made use of it to control the pressure
of steam.</p>

<p>From England, Papin went to Italy, where he accepted
membership and held official position in the Italian Academy
of Science. Papin remained in Venice two years, and
then returned to England. Here, in 1687, he announced one
of his inventions, which is just becoming of great value in the
arts. He proposed to transmit power from one point to another,
over long distances, by the now well-known &#8220;pneumatic&#8221;
method. At the point where power was available,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he exhausted a chamber by means of an air-pump, and, leading
a pipe to the distant point at which it was to be utilized,
there withdrew the air from behind a piston, and the pressure
of the air upon the latter caused it to recede into the
cylinder, in which it was fitted, raising a weight, of which
the magnitude was proportionate to the size of the piston
and the degree of exhaustion. Papin was not satisfactorily
successful in his experiments; but he had created the germ
of the modern system of pneumatic transmission of power.
His disappointment at the result of his efforts to utilize
the system was very great, and he became despondent, and
anxious to change his location again.</p>

<p>In 1687 he was offered the chair of Mathematics at
Marburg by Charles, the Landgrave of Upper Hesse, and,
accepting the appointment, went to Germany. He remained
in Germany many years, and continued his researches with
renewed activity and interest. His papers were published
in the &#8220;Acta Eruditorum&#8221; at Leipsic, and in the &#8220;Philosophical
Transactions&#8221; at London. It was while at Marburg
that his papers descriptive of his method of pneumatic
transmission of power were printed.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In the &#8220;Acta Eruditorum&#8221; of 1688 he exhibited a practicable
plan, in which he exhausted the air from a set of
engines or pumps by means of pumps situated at a long distance
from the point of application of the power, and at the
place where the prime mover&mdash;which was in this case a
water-wheel&mdash;was erected.</p>

<p>After his arrival at the University of Marburg, Papin
exhibited to his colleagues in the faculty a modification of
Huyghens&#8217;s gunpowder-engine, in which he had endeavored
to obtain a more perfect vacuum than had Huyghens in the
first of these machines. Disappointed in this, he finally
adopted the expedient of employing steam to displace the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
air, and to produce, by its condensation, the perfect vacuum
which he sought; and he thus produced <i>the first steam-engine
with a piston</i>, and the first piston steam-engine, in which
condensation was produced to secure a vacuum. It was described
in the &#8220;Acta&#8221; of Leipsic,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in June, 1690, under the
title, &#8220;Nova Methodus ad vires motrices validissimas leri
pretio comparandeo&#8221; (&#8220;A New Method of securing cheaply
Motive Power of considerable Magnitude&#8221;). He describes
first the gunpowder-engine, and continues by stating that,
&#8220;until now, all experiments have been unsuccessful; and
after the combustion of the exploded powder, there always
remains in the cylinder about one-fifth its volume of air.&#8221;
He says that he has endeavored to arrive by another route
at the same end; and &#8220;as, by a natural property of water,
a small quantity of this liquid, vaporized by the action of
heat, acquires an elasticity like that of the air, and returns
to the liquid state again on cooling, without retaining the
least trace of its elastic force,&#8221; he thought that it would be
easy to construct machines in which, &#8220;by
means of a moderate heat, and without
much expense,&#8221; a more perfect vacuum
could be produced than could be secured
by the use of gunpowder.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig17" id="Fig17"></a>
<img src="images/illo077.png" alt="Papin's Engine" width="183" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Papin&#8217;s Engine.</p></div>

<p>The first machine of Papin (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>)
was very similar to the gunpowder-engine
already described as the invention
of Huyghens. In place of gunpowder, a
small quantity of water is placed at the
bottom of the cylinder, <i>A</i>; a fire is built
beneath it, &#8220;the bottom being made of
very thin metal,&#8221; and the steam formed
soon raises the piston, <i>B</i>, to the top,
where a latch, <i>E</i>, engaging a notch in
the piston-rod, <i>H</i>, holds it up until it is desired that it shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
drop. The fire being removed, the steam condenses, and a
vacuum is formed below the piston, and the latch, <i>E</i>, being
disengaged, the piston is driven down by the superincumbent
atmosphere and raises the weight which has been, meantime,
attached to a rope, <i>L</i>, passing from the piston-rod over pulleys,
<i>T T</i>. The machine had a cylinder two and a half inches
in diameter, and raised 60 pounds once a minute; and
Papin calculated that a machine of a little more than two
feet diameter of cylinder and of four feet stroke would raise
8,000 pounds four feet per minute&mdash;i. e., that it would yield
about one horse-power.</p>

<p>The inventor claimed that this new machine would be
found useful in relieving mines from water, in throwing
bombs, in ship-propulsion, attaching revolving paddles&mdash;i. e.,
paddle-wheels&mdash;to the sides of the vessel, which wheels were
to be driven by several of his engines, in order to secure
continuous motion, the piston-rods being fitted with racks
which were to engage ratchet-wheels on the paddle-shafts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal difficulty,&#8221; he says, answering anticipated
objections, &#8220;is that of making these large cylinders.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a reprint describing his invention, in 1695, Papin
gives a description of a &#8220;newly-invented furnace,&#8221; a kind
of fire-box steam-boiler, in which the fire, completely surrounded
by water, makes steam so rapidly that his engine
could be driven at the rate of four strokes per minute by
the steam supplied by it.</p>

<p>Papin also proposed the use of a peculiar form of furnace
with this engine, which, embodying as it does some
suggestions that very probably have since been attributed
to later inventors, deserves special notice. In this furnace,
Papin proposed to burn his fuel on a grate within a furnace
arranged with a <i>down-draught</i>, the air entering above the
grate, passing <i>down</i> through the fire, and from the ash-pit
through a side flue to the chimney. In starting the fire,
the coal was laid on the grate, covered with wood, and the
latter was ignited, the flame, passing downward through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
coal, igniting that in turn, and, as claimed by Papin, the
combustion was complete, and the formation of smoke was
entirely prevented. He states, in &#8220;Acta Eruditorum,&#8221;
that the heat was intense, the saving of fuel very great,
and that the only difficulty was to find a refractory material
which would withstand the high temperature attained.</p>

<p>This is the first fire-box and flue boiler of which we have
record. The experiment is supposed to have led Papin to
suggest the use of a hot-blast, as practised by Neilson more
than a century later, for reducing metals from their ores.</p>

<p>Papin made another boiler having a flue winding through
the water-space, and presenting a heating surface of nearly
80 square feet. The flue had a length of 24 feet, and
was about 10 inches square. It is not stated what were
the maximum pressures carried on these boilers; but it
is known that Papin had used very high pressures in his
digesters&mdash;probably between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds per
square inch.</p>

<p>In the year 1705, Leibnitz, then visiting England, had
seen a Savery engine, and, on his return, described it to
Papin, sending him a sketch of the machine. Papin read
the letter and exhibited the sketch to the Landgrave of
Hesse, and Charles at once urged him to endeavor to perfect
his own machine, and to continue the researches which he
had been intermittently pursuing since the earlier machine
had been exhibited in public.</p>

<p>In a small pamphlet printed at Cassel in 1707,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Papin
describes a new form of engine, in which he discards the
original plan of a modified Huyghens engine, with tight-fitting
piston and cylinder, raising its load by indirect action,
and makes a modified Savery engine, which he calls
the &#8220;Elector&#8217;s Engine,&#8221; in honor of his patron. This is
the engine shown in the engraving, and as proposed to be
used by him in turning a water-wheel.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Papin&#8217;s Engine and Water-Wheel,
<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1707.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>The sketch is that given by the inventor in his memoir.
It consists (<a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>) of a steam-boiler, <i>a</i>, from which steam is
led through the cock, <i>c</i>, to the working cylinder, <i>n n</i>. The water
beneath the floating-piston, <i>h</i>, which latter serves simply as
a cushion to protect the steam from sudden condensation or
contact with the water, is forced into the vessel <i>r r</i>, which
is a large air-chamber, and which serves to render the outflow
of water comparatively uniform, and the discharge occurs
by means of the pipe <i>q</i>, from which the water rises to
the desired height. A fresh supply of water is introduced
through the funnel <i>k</i>, after condensation of the steam in <i>n n</i>,
and the operation of expulsion is repeated.</p>

<p>This machine is evidently a retrogression, and Papin,
after having earned the honor of having invented the first
steam-engine of the typical form which has since become
so universally applied, forfeited that credit by his evident
ignorance of its superiority over existing devices, and by
attempting unsuccessfully to perfect the inferior device of
another inventor.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Papin made an attempt to apply the
steam-engine to the propulsion of vessels, the account of
which will be given in the chapter on Steam-Navigation.</p>

<p>Again disappointed, Papin once more visited England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to renew his acquaintance with the <i>savans</i> of the Royal
Society; but Boyle had died during the period which Papin
had spent in Germany, and the unhappy and disheartened
inventor and philosopher died in 1810, without having
seen any one of his many devices and ingenious inventions
a practical success.</p>

<h3><i>THE STEAM-ENGINE AS A TRAIN OF MECHANISM.</i></h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The introduction of new Inventions seemeth to be the very chief of
all human Actions. The Benefits of new Inventions may extend to all
Mankind universally; but the Good of political Achievements can respect
but some particular Cantons of Men; these latter do not endure above a

<h4><span class="smcap">The Modern Type, as Developed by Newcomen,
Beighton, and Smeaton.</span></h4>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century every element
of the modern type of steam-engine had been separately
invented and practically applied. The character of
atmospheric pressure, and of the pressure of gases, had become
understood. The nature of a vacuum was known,
and the method of obtaining it by the displacement of the
air by steam, and by the condensation of the vapor, was
understood. The importance of utilizing the power of steam,
and the application of condensation in the removal of atmospheric
pressure, was not only recognized, but had been
actually and successfully attempted by Morland, Papin,
and Savery.</p>

<p>Mechanicians had succeeded in making steam-boilers
capable of sustaining any desired or any useful pressure,
and Papin had shown how to make them comparatively safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by the attachment of the safety-valve. They had made
steam-cylinders fitted with pistons, and had used such a
combination in the development of power.</p>

<p>It now only remained for the engineer to combine known
forms of mechanism in a practical machine which should be
capable of economically and conveniently utilizing the power
of steam through the application of now well-understood
principles, and by the intelligent combination of physical
phenomena already familiar to scientific investigators.</p>

<p>Every essential fact and every vital principle had been
learned, and every one of the needed mechanical combinations
had been successfully effected. It was only requisite
that an inventor should appear, capable of perceiving that
these known facts and combinations of mechanism, properly
illustrated in a working machine, would present to the
world its greatest physical blessing.</p>

<p>The defects of the simple engines constructed up to this
time have been noted as each has been described. None of
them could be depended upon for safe, economical, and continuous
work. Savery&#8217;s was the most successful of all. But
the engine of Savery, even with the improvements of Desaguliers,
was unsafe where most needed, because of the
high pressures necessarily carried in its boilers when pumping
from considerable depths; it was uneconomical, in consequence
of the great loss of heat in its forcing-cylinders
when the hot steam was surrounded at its entrance by colder
bodies; it was slow in operation, of great first cost, and
expensive in first cost and in repairs, as well as in its operation.
It could not be relied upon to do its work uninterruptedly,
and was thus in many respects a very unsatisfactory
machine.</p>

<p>The man who finally effected a combination of the elements
of the modern steam-engine, and produced a machine
which is unmistakably a true engine&mdash;i. e., a train of mechanism
consisting of several elementary pieces combined in
a train capable of transmitting a force applied at one end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and of communicating it to the resistance to be overcome
at the other end&mdash;was <span class="smcap">Thomas Newcomen</span>, an &#8220;iron-monger&#8221;
and blacksmith of Dartmouth, England. The engine
invented by him, and known as the &#8220;Atmospheric Steam-Engine,&#8221;
is the first of an entirely new type.</p>

<p>The old type of engine&mdash;the steam-engine as a simple
machine&mdash;had been given as great a degree of perfection,
by the successive improvements of Worcester, Savery, and
Desaguliers, as it was probably capable of attaining by any
modification of its details. The next step was necessarily
a complete change of type; and to effect such a change, it
was only necessary to combine devices already known and
successfully tried.</p>

<p>But little is known of the personal history of Newcomen.
His position in life was humble, and the inventor
was not then looked upon as an individual of even possible
importance in the community. He was considered as one
of an eccentric class of schemers, and of an order which,
concerning itself with mechanical matters, held the lowest
position in the class.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Savery&#8217;s engine was perfectly well
known to Newcomen, and that the latter may have visited
Savery at his home in Modbury, which was but fifteen
miles from the residence of Newcomen. It is thought, by
some biographers of these inventors, that Newcomen was
employed by Savery in making the more intricate forgings
of his engine. Harris, in his &#8220;Lexicon Technicum,&#8221; states
that drawings of the engine of Savery came into the hands
of Newcomen, who made a model of the machine, set it up
in his garden, and then attempted its improvement; but
Switzer says that Newcomen &#8220;was as early in his invention
as Mr. Savery was in his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Newcomen was assisted in his experiments by John Calley,
who, with him, took out the patent. It has been stated
that a visit to Cornwall, where they witnessed the working
of a Savery engine, first turned their attention to the subject;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
but a friend of Savery has stated that Newcomen
was as early with his general plans as Savery.</p>

<p>After some discussion with Calley, Newcomen entered
into correspondence with Dr. Hooke, proposing a steam-engine
to consist of a <i>steam-cylinder containing a piston
similar to that of Papin&#8217;s, and to drive a separate pump</i>,
similar to those generally in use where water was raised by
horse or wind power. Dr. Hooke advised and argued strongly
against their plan, but, fortunately, the obstinate belief
of the unlearned mechanics was not overpowered by the
disquisitions of their distinguished correspondent, and Newcomen
and Calley attempted an engine on their peculiar
plan. This succeeded so well as to induce them to continue
their labors, and, in 1705, to patent,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in combination with
Savery&mdash;who held the exclusive right to practise surface-condensation,
and who induced them to allow him an interest
with them&mdash;an engine combining a steam-cylinder and
piston, surface-condensation, a separate boiler, and separate
pumps.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig19" id="Fig19"></a>
<img src="images/illo086.png" alt="Newcomen's Engine" width="400" height="455" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Newcomen&#8217;s Engine, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1705.</p></div>

<p>In the atmospheric-engine, as first designed, the slow
process of condensation by the application of the condensing
water to the exterior of the cylinder, to produce the
vacuum, caused the strokes of the engine to take place at
very long intervals. An improvement was, however, soon
effected, which immensely increased the rapidity of condensation.
A jet of water was thrown directly <i>into</i> the
cylinder, thus effecting for the Newcomen engine just
what Desaguliers had done for the Savery engine previously.
As thus improved, the Newcomen engine is shown
in <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>

<p>Here <i>b</i> is the boiler. Steam passes from it through the
cock, <i>d</i>, and up into the cylinder, <i>a</i>, equilibrating the pressure
of the atmosphere, and allowing the heavy pump-rod, <i>k</i>, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
fall, and, by the greater weight acting through the beam, <i>i i</i>,
to raise the piston, <i>s</i>, to the position shown. The rod <i>m</i> carries
a counterbalance, if needed. The cock <i>d</i> being shut, <i>f</i>
is then opened, and a jet of water from the reservoir, <i>g</i>, enters
the cylinder, producing a vacuum by the condensation
of the steam. The pressure of the air above the piston now
forces it down, again raising the pump-rods, and thus the
engine works on indefinitely.</p>

<p>The pipe <i>h</i> is used for the purpose of keeping the upper
side of the piston covered with water, to prevent air-leaks&mdash;a
device of Newcomen. Two gauge-cocks, <i>c c</i>, and a safety-valve,
<i>N</i>, are represented in the figure, but it will be noticed
that the latter is quite different from the now usual form.
Here, the pressure used was hardly greater than that of the
atmosphere, and the weight of the valve itself was ordinarily
sufficient to keep it down. The condensing water, together
with the water of condensation, flows off through
the open pipe <i>p</i>. Newcomen&#8217;s first engine made 6 or 8<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
strokes a minute; the later and improved engines made 10
or 12.</p>

<p>The steam-engine has now assumed a form that somewhat
resembles the modern machine.</p>

<p>The Newcomen engine is seen at a glance to have been
a combination of earlier ideas. It was the engine of Huyghens,
with its cylinder and piston as improved by Papin,
by the substitution of steam for the gases generated by the
explosion of gunpowder; still further improved by Newcomen
and Calley by the addition of the method of condensation
used in the Savery engine. It was further modified,
with the object of applying it directly to the working
of the pumps of the mines by the introduction of the overhead
beam, from which the piston was suspended at one
end and the pump-rod at the other.</p>

<p>The advantages secured by this combination of inventions
were many and manifest. The piston not only gave
economy by interposing itself between the impelling and
the resisting fluid, but, by affording opportunity to make
the area of piston as large as desired, it enabled Newcomen
to use any convenient pressure and any desired proportions
for any proposed lift. The removal of the water to be
lifted from the steam-engine proper and handling it with
pumps, was an evident cause of very great economy of
steam.</p>

<p>The disposal of the water to be raised in this way also
permitted the operations of condensation of steam, and the
renewal of pressure on the piston, to be made to succeed
each other with rapidity, and enabled the inventor to choose,
unhampered, the device for securing promptly the action of
condensation.</p>

<p>Desaguliers, in his account of the introduction of the
engine of Newcomen, says that, with his coadjutor Calley,
he &#8220;made several experiments in private about the year
1710, and in the latter end of the year 1711 made proposals
to drain the water of a colliery at Griff, in Warwickshire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
where the proprietors employed 500 horses, at an expense
of &pound;900 a year; but, their invention not meeting with the
reception they expected, in March following, through the
acquaintance of Mr. Potter, of Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire,
they bargained to draw water for Mr. Back, of
Wolverhampton, where, after a great many laborious attempts,
they did make the engine work; but, not being
either philosophers to understand the reason, or mathematicians
enough to calculate the powers and proportions of
the parts, they very luckily, by accident, found what they
sought for.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were at a loss about the pumps, but, being so
near Birmingham, and having the assistance of so many admirable
and ingenious workmen, they came, about 1712, to
the method of making the pump-valves, clacks, and buckets,
whereas they had but an imperfect notion of them before.
One thing is very remarkable: as they were at first working,
they were surprised to see the engine go several strokes,
and very quick together, when, after a search, they found a
hole in the piston, which let the cold water in to condense
the steam in the inside of the cylinder, whereas, before, they
had always done it on the outside. They used before to
work with a buoy to the cylinder, inclosed in a pipe, which
buoy rose when the steam was strong and opened the injection,
and made a stroke; thereby they were only capable
of giving 6, 8, or 10 strokes in a minute, till a boy, named
Humphrey Potter, in 1713, who attended the engine, added
(what he called a <i>scoggan</i>) a catch, that the beam always
opened, and then it would go 15 or 16 strokes a minute.
But, this being perplexed with catches and strings, Mr.
Henry Beighton, in an engine he had built at Newcastle-upon-Tyne
in 1718, took them all away but the beam itself,
and supplied them in a much better manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>In illustration of the application of the Newcomen engine
to the drainage of mines, Farey describes a small
machine, of which the pump is 8 inches in diameter, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the lift 162 feet. The column of water to be raised weighed
3,535 pounds. The steam-piston was made 2 feet in diameter,
giving an area of 452 square inches. The net working-pressure
was assumed at 10<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pounds per square inch; the
temperature of the water of condensation and of uncondensed
vapor after the entrance of the injection-water being
usually about 150&deg; Fahr. This gave an excess of pressure
on the steam-side of 1,324 pounds, the total pressure on the
piston being 4,859 pounds. One-half of this excess is counterweighted
by the pump-rods, and by weight on that end
of the beam; and the weight, 662 pounds, acting on each
side alternately as a surplus, produced the requisite rapidity
of movement of the machine. This engine was said to
make 15 strokes per minute, giving a speed of piston of 75
feet per minute, and the power exerted usefully was equivalent
to 265,125 pounds raised one foot high per minute.
As the horse-power is equivalent to 33,000 &#8220;foot-pounds&#8221;
per minute, the engine was of <span class="enum">265125</span>&#8725;
<span class="denom">33000</span> = 8.034&mdash;almost exactly
8 horse-power.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig20" id="Fig20"></a>
<img src="images/illo090.png" alt="Beighton's Valve Gear" width="350" height="491" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Beighton&#8217;s Valve-Gear, <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1718.</p></div>

<p>It is instructive to contrast this estimate with that made
for a Savery engine doing the same work. The latter would
have raised the water about 26 feet in its &#8220;suction-pipe,&#8221;
and would then have forced it, by the direct pressure of
steam, the remaining distance of 136 feet; and the steam-pressure
required would have been nearly 60 pounds per
square inch. With this high temperature and pressure, the
waste of steam by condensation in the forcing-vessels would
have been so great that it would have compelled the adoption
of two engines of considerable size, each lifting the
water one-half the height, and using steam of about 25
pounds pressure. Potter&#8217;s rude valve-gear was soon improved
by Henry Beighton, in an engine which that talented
engineer erected at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1718, and in
which he substituted substantial materials for the cords, as
in <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>In this sketch, <i>r</i> is a plug-tree, plug-rod, or plug-frame,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
as it is variously called, suspended from the great beam,
with which it rises and falls, bringing the pins <i>p</i> and <i>k</i>, at
the proper moment, in contact with the handles <i>k k</i> and <i>n n</i>
of the valves, moving them in the proper direction and to
the proper extent. A lever safety-valve is here used, at
the suggestion, it is said, of Desaguliers. The piston was
packed with leather or with rope, and lubricated with tallow.</p>

<p>After the death of Beighton, the atmospheric engine of
Newcomen retained its then standard form for many years,
and came into extensive use in all the mining districts, particularly
in Cornwall, and was also applied occasionally to
the drainage of wet lands, to the supply of water to towns,
and it was even proposed by Hulls to be used for ship-propulsion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The proportions of the engines had been determined in a
hap-hazard way, and they were in many cases very unsafe.
John Smeaton, the most distinguished engineer of his time,
finally, in 1769, experimentally determined proper proportions,
and built several of these engines of very considerable
size. He built his engines with steam-cylinders of
greater length of stroke than had been customary, and gave
them such dimensions as, by giving a greater excess of
pressure on the steam-side, enabled him to obtain a greatly-increased
speed of piston. The first of his new style of engine
was erected at Long Benton, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
in 1774.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
illustrates its principal characteristic features.
The boiler is not shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig21" id="Fig21"></a>

<p class="center fsize80"><a href="images/large092.jpg">Large scale image.</a></p></div>

<p>The steam is led to the engine through the pipe, <i>C</i>, and
is regulated by turning the cock in the receiver, <i>D</i>, which
connects with the steam-cylinder by the pipe, <i>E</i>, which
latter pipe rises a little way above the bottom of the cylinder,
<i>F</i>, in order that it may not drain off the injection-water
into the steam-pipe and receiver.</p>

<p>The steam-cylinder, about ten feet in length, is fitted
with a carefully-made piston, <i>G</i>, having a flanch rising four
or five inches and extending completely around its circumference,
and nearly in contact with the interior surface of
the cylinder. Between this flanch and the cylinder is driven
a &#8220;packing&#8221; of oakum, which is held in place by weights;
this prevents the leakage of air, water, or steam, past the
piston, as it rises and falls in the cylinder at each stroke of
the engine. The chain and piston-rod connect the piston
to the beam, <i>I I</i>. The arch-heads at each end of the beam
keep the chains of the piston-rod and the pump-rods perpendicular
and in line.</p>

<p>A &#8220;jack-head&#8221; pump, <i>N</i>, is driven by a small beam deriving
its motion from the plug-rod at <i>g</i>, raises the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
required for condensing the steam, and keeps the cistern, <i>O</i>,
supplied. This &#8220;jack-head cistern&#8221; is sufficiently elevated
to give the water entering the cylinder the velocity requisite
to secure prompt condensation. A waste-pipe carries away
any surplus water. The injection-water is led from the cistern
by the pipe, <i>P P</i>, which is two or three inches in diameter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and the flow of water is regulated by the injection-cock,
<i>r</i>. The cap at the end, <i>d</i>, is pierced with several holes,
and the stream thus divided rises in jets when admitted,
and, striking the lower side of the piston, the spray thus
produced very rapidly condenses the steam, and produces a
vacuum beneath the piston. The valve, <i>e</i>, on the upper end
of the injection-pipe, is a check-valve, to prevent leakage
into the engine when the latter is not in operation. The
little pipe, <i>f</i>, supplies water to the upper side of the piston,
and, keeping it flooded, prevents the entrance of air when
the packing is not perfectly tight.</p>

<p>The &#8220;working-plug,&#8221; or plug-rod, <i>Q</i>, is a piece of timber
slit vertically, and carrying pins which engage the
handles of the valves, opening and closing them at the
proper times. The steam-cock, or regulator, has a handle,
<i>h</i>, by which it is moved. The iron rod, <i>i i</i>, or spanner, gives
motion to the handle, <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>The vibrating lever, <i>k l</i>, called the <i>Y</i>, or the &#8220;tumbling-bob,&#8221;
moves on the pins, <i>m n</i>, and is worked by the levers,
<i>o p</i>, which in turn are moved by the plug-tree. When <i>o</i>
is depressed, the loaded end, <i>k</i>, is given the position seen in
the sketch, and the leg <i>l</i> of the <i>Y</i> strikes the spanner, <i>i i</i>,
and, opening the steam-valve, the piston at once rises as
steam enters the cylinder, until another pin on the plug-rod
raises the piece, <i>P</i>, and closes the regulator again. The
lever, <i>q r</i>, connects with the injection-cock, and is moved,
when, as the piston rises, the end, <i>q</i>, is struck by a pin on
the plug-rod, and the cock is opened and a vacuum produced.
The cock is closed on the descent of the plug-tree
with the piston. An eduction-pipe, <i>R</i>, fitted with a clock,
conveys away the water in the cylinder at the end of each
down-stroke; the water thus removed is collected in the
hot-well, <i>S</i>, and is used as feed-water for the boiler, to which
it is conveyed by the pipe <i>T</i>. At each down-stroke, while
the water passes out through <i>R</i>, the air which may have
collected in the cylinder is driven out through the &#8220;snifting-valve,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<i>s</i>. The steam-cylinder is supported on strong
beams, <i>t t</i>; it has around its upper edge a guard, <i>v</i>, of lead,
which prevents the overflow of the water on the top of the
piston. The excess of this water flows away to the hot-well
through the pipe <i>W</i>.</p>

<p>Catch-pins, <i>x</i>, are provided, to prevent the beam descending
too far should the engine make too long a stroke; two
wooden springs, <i>y y</i>, receive the blow. The great beam is
carried on sectors, <i>z z</i>, to diminish losses by friction.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Boiler of Newcomen&#8217;s<br />Engine, 1768.</p></div>

<p>The boilers of Newcomen&#8217;s earlier engines were made of
copper where in contact with the products of combustion,
and their upper parts were of lead. Subsequently, sheet-iron
was substituted. The steam-space in the boiler was
made of 8 or 10 times the capacity of the cylinder of the
engine. Even in Smeaton&#8217;s time, a chimney-damper was
not used, and the supply of steam was consequently very
variable. In the earlier engines, the
cylinder was placed on the boiler;
afterward, they were placed separately,
and supported on a foundation
of masonry. The injection or
&#8220;jack-head&#8221; cistern was placed from
12 to 30 feet above the engine, the
velocity due the greater altitude
being found to give the most perfect
distribution of the water and the
promptest condensation.</p>

<p>Smeaton covered the lower side
of his steam-pistons with wooden
plank about 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> inches thick, in order
that it should absorb and waste less
heat than when the iron was directly
exposed to the steam. Mr. Beighton was the first to use the
water of condensation for feeding the boiler, taking it directly
from the eduction-pipe, or the &#8220;hot-well.&#8221; Where
only a sufficient amount of pure water could be obtained for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
feeding the boiler, and the injection-water was &#8220;hard,&#8221; Mr.
Smeaton applied a heater, immersed in the hot-well, through
which the feed passed, absorbing heat from the water of
condensation <i>en route</i> to the boiler. Farey first proposed
the use of the &#8220;coil-heater&#8221;&mdash;a pipe, or &#8220;worm,&#8221; which,
forming a part of the feed-pipe, was set in the hot-well.</p>

<p>As early as 1743, the metal used for the cylinders was cast-iron.
The earlier engines had been fitted with brass cylinders.
Desaguliers recommended the iron cylinders, as being
smoother, thinner, and as having less capacity for heat than
those of brass.</p>

<p>In a very few years after the invention of Newcomen&#8217;s
engine it had been introduced into nearly all large mines in
Great Britain; and many new mines, which could not have
been worked at all previously, were opened, when it was
found that the new machine could be relied upon to raise
the large quantities of water to be handled. The first engine
in Scotland was erected in 1720 at Elphinstone, in
Stirlingshire. One was put up in Hungary in 1723.</p>

<p>The first mine-engine, erected in 1712 at Griff, was 22
inches in diameter, and the second and third engines were
of similar size. That erected at Ansthorpe was 23 inches
in diameter of cylinder, and it was a long time before much
larger engines were constructed. Smeaton and others
finally made them as large as 6 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>In calculating the lifting-power of his engines, Newcomen&#8217;s
method was &#8220;to square the diameter of the cylinder
in inches, and, cutting off the last figure, he called it
&#8216;long hundredweights;&#8217; then writing a cipher on the right
hand, he called the number on that side &#8216;odd pounds;&#8217; this
he reckoned tolerably exact at a mean, or rather when the
barometer was above 30 inches, and the air heavy.&#8221; In
allowing for frictional and other losses, he deducted from
one-fourth to one-third. Desaguliers found the rule quite
exact. The usual mean pressure resisting the motion of
the piston averaged, in the best engines, about 8 pounds per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
square inch of its area. The speed of the piston was from
150 to 175 feet per minute. The temperature of the hot-well
was from 145&deg; to 175&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>Smeaton made a number of test-trials of Newcomen
engines to determine their &#8220;duty&#8221;&mdash;i. e., to ascertain the
expenditure of fuel required to raise a definite quantity of
water to a stated height. He found an engine 10 inches in
diameter of cylinder, and of 3 feet stroke, could do work
equal to raising 2,919,017 pounds of water one foot high,
with a bushel of coals weighing 84 pounds.</p>

<p>One of Smeaton&#8217;s larger engines, erected at Long Benton,
was 52 inches in diameter of cylinder and of 7 feet
stroke of piston, and made 12 strokes per minute. Its load
was equal to 7<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> pounds per square inch of piston-area, and
its effective capacity about 40 horse-power. Its duty was
9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> millions of pounds raised one foot high per bushel of
coals. Its boiler evaporated 7.88 pounds of water per
pound of fuel consumed. It had 35 square feet of grate-surface
and 142 square feet of heating-surface beneath the
boilers, and 317 square feet in the flues&mdash;a total of 459
square feet. The moving parts of this engine weighed
8<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons.</p>

<p>Smeaton erected one of these engines at the Chasewater
mine, in Cornwall, in 1775, which was of very considerable
size. It was 6 feet in diameter of steam-cylinder, and had
a maximum stroke of piston of 9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet. It usually worked
9 feet. The pumps were in three lifts of about 100 feet
each, and were 16<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> inches in diameter. Nine strokes were
made per minute. This engine replaced two others, of 64
and of 62 inches diameter of cylinder respectively, and both
of 6 feet stroke. One engine at the lower lift supplied the
second, which was set above it. The lower one had pumps
18<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter, and raised the water 144 feet; the
upper engine raised the water 156 feet, by pumps 17<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches
in diameter. The later engine replacing them exerted 76<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
horse-power. There were three boilers, each 15 feet in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
diameter, and having each 23 square feet of grate-surface.
The chimney was 22 feet high. The great beam, or &#8220;lever,&#8221;
of this engine was built up of 20 beams of fir in two sets,
placed side by side, and ten deep, strongly bolted together.
It was over 6 feet deep at the middle and 5 feet at the
ends, and was 2 feet thick. The &#8220;main centres,&#8221; or journals,
on which it vibrated were 8<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter and
8<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches long. The cylinder weighed 6<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons, and was
paid for at the rate of 28 shillings per hundredweight.</p>

<p>By the end of the eighteenth century, therefore, the engine
of Newcomen, perfected by the ingenuity of Potter
and of Beighton, and by the systematic study and experimental
research of Smeaton, had become a well-established
form of steam-engine, and its application to raising water
had become general. The coal-mines of Coventry and of
Newcastle had adopted this method of drainage; and the tin
and the copper mines of Cornwall had been deepened, using,
for drainage, engines of the largest size.</p>

<p>Some engines had been set up in and about London, the
scene of Worcester&#8217;s struggles and disappointments, where
they were used to supply water to large houses. Others
were in use in other large cities of England, where water-works
had been erected.</p>

<p>Some engines had also been erected to drive mills indirectly
by raising water to turn water-wheels. This is said
by Farey to have been first practised in 1752, at a mill near
Bristol, and became common during the next quarter of a
century. Many engines had been built in England and
sent across the channel, to be applied to the drainage of
mines on the Continent. Belidor<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
stated that the manufacture
of these &#8220;fire-engines&#8221; was exclusively confined to
England; and this remained true many years after his time.
When used for the drainage of mines, the engine usually
worked the ordinary lift or bucket pump; when employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for water-supply to cities, the force or plunger pump was
often employed, the engine being placed below the level of
the reservoir. Dr. Rees states that this engine was in common
use among the collieries of England as early as 1725.</p>

<p>The Edmonstone colliery was licensed, in 1725, to erect
an engine, not to exceed 28 inches diameter of cylinder and
9 feet stroke of piston, paying a royalty of &pound;80 per annum
for eight years. This engine was built in Scotland, by
workmen sent from England, and cost about &pound;1,200. Its
&#8220;great cost&#8221; is attributed to an extensive use of brass.
The workmen were paid their expenses and 15<i>s.</i> per week
as wages. The builders were John and Abraham Potter,
of Durham. An engine built in 1775, having a steam-cylinder
48 inches in diameter and of 7 feet stroke, cost about
&pound;2,000.</p>

<p>Smeaton found 57 engines at work near Newcastle in
1767, ranging in size from 28 to 75 inches in diameter of
cylinder, and of, collectively, about 1,200 horse-power. Fifteen
of these engines gave an average of 98 square inches
of piston to the horse-power, and the average duty was
5,590,000 pounds raised 1 foot high by 1 bushel (84 pounds)
of coal. The highest duty noted was 7.44 millions; the
lowest was 3.22 millions. The most efficient engine had a
steam-cylinder 42 inches in diameter; the load was equivalent
to 9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pounds per square inch of piston-area, and the
horse-power developed was calculated to be 16.7.</p>

<p>Price, writing in 1778, says, in the Appendix to his
&#8220;Mineralogia Cornubiensis:&#8221; &#8220;Mr. Newcomen&#8217;s invention
of the fire-engine enabled us to sink our mines to twice the
depth we could formerly do by any other machinery. Since
this invention was completed, most other attempts at its
improvement have been very unsuccessful; but the vast
consumption of fuel in these engines is an immense drawback
on the profit of our mines, for every fire-engine of
magnitude consumes &pound;3,000 worth of coals per annum.
This heavy tax amounts almost to a prohibition.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Smeaton was given the description, in 1773, of a <i>stone</i>
boiler, which was used with one of these engines at a copper
mine at Camborne, in Cornwall. It contained three copper
flues 22 inches in diameter. The gases were passed through
these flues successively, finally passing off to the chimney.
This boiler was cemented with hydraulic mortar. It was
20 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 8<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet deep. It was heated
by the waste heat from the roasting-furnaces. This was
one of the earliest flue-boilers ever made.</p>

<p>In 1780, Smeaton had a list of 18 large engines working
in Cornwall. The larger number of them were built
by Jonathan Hornblower and John Nancarron. At this
time, the largest and best-known pumping-engine for water-works
was at York Buildings, in Villiers Street, Strand,
London. It had been in operation since 1752, and was
erected beside one of Savery&#8217;s engines, built in 1710. It
had a steam-cylinder 45 inches in diameter, and a stroke
of piston of 8 feet, making 7<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> strokes per minute, and developing
35<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> horse-power. Its boiler was dome-shaped,
of copper, and contained a large central fire-box and a
spiral flue leading outward to the chimney. Another
somewhat larger machine was built and placed beside this
engine, some time previous to 1775. Its cylinder was 49
inches in diameter, and its stroke 9 feet. It raised water
102 feet. This engine was altered and improved by Smeaton
in 1777, and continued in use until 1813.</p>

<p>Smeaton, as early as 1765, designed a <i>portable</i> engine,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
in which he supported the machinery on a wooden frame
mounted on short legs and strongly put together, so that
the whole machine could be transported and set at work
wherever convenient.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;Smeaton&#8217;s Portable-Engine<br />Boiler, 1765.</p></div>

<p>In place of the beam, a large pulley was used, over
which a chain was carried, connecting the piston with the
pump-rod, and the motion was similar to that given by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
discarded beam. The wheel was supported on A-frames,
resembling somewhat the &#8220;gallows-frames&#8221; still used with
the beam-engines of American river-boats. The sills carrying
the two A&#8217;s supported the cylinder. The injection-cistern
was supported above the great pulley-wheel. The
valve-gearing and the injection-pump were worked by a
smaller wheel, mounted on the same axis with the larger
one. The boiler was placed apart from the engine, with
which it was connected by a steam-pipe, in which was
placed the &#8220;regulator,&#8221; or throttle-valve. The boiler (<a href="#Fig23">Fig.
23</a>) &#8220;was shaped like a large tea-kettle,&#8221; and contained a
fire-box, <i>B</i>, or internal furnace, of which the sides were
made of cast-iron. The fire-door, <i>C</i>, was placed on one
side and opposite the flue, <i>D</i>, through which the products of
combustion were led to the chimney, <i>E</i>; a short, large pipe,
<i>F</i>, leading downward from the furnace to the outside of the
boiler, was the ash-pit. The shell of the boiler, <i>A</i>, was made
of iron plate one-quarter of an inch thick. The steam-cylinder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the engine was 18 inches in diameter, the stroke of
piston 6 feet, the great wheel 6<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter, and the
A-frames 9 feet high. The boiler was made 6 feet, the furnace
34 inches, and the grate 18 inches in diameter. The
piston was intended to make 10 strokes per minute, and the
engine to develop 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span> horse-power.</p>

<p>In 1773, Smeaton prepared plans for a pumping-engine
to be set up at Cronstadt, the port of St. Petersburg, to
empty the great dry dock constructed by Peter the Great
and Catherine, his successor. This great dock was begun
in 1719. It was large enough to dock ten of the ships of
that time, and had previously been imperfectly drained by
two great windmills 100 feet high. So imperfectly did they
do their work, that a <i>year</i> was required to empty the dock,
and it could therefore only be used once in each summer.
The engine was built at the Carron Iron Works, in England.
It had a cylinder 66 inches in diameter, and a stroke
of piston of 8<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet. The lift varied from 33 feet when
the dock was full to 53 feet when it was cleared of water.
The load on the engine averaged about 8<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">3</span> pounds per
square inch of piston-area. There were three boilers, each
10 feet in diameter, and 16 feet 4 inches high to the apex of
its hemispherical dome. They contained internal fire-boxes
with grates of 20 feet area, and were surrounded by flues
helically traversing the masonry setting. The engine was
started in 1777, and worked very successfully.</p>

<p>The lowlands of Holland were, before the time of Smeaton,
drained by means of windmills. The uncertainty and
inefficiency of this method precluded its application to anything
like the extent to which steam-power has since been
utilized. In 1440, there were 150 inland lakes, or &#8220;<i>meers</i>,&#8221;
in that country, of which nearly 100, having an extent of
over 200,000 acres, have since been drained. The &#8220;Haarlemmer
Meer&#8221; alone covers nearly 50,000 acres, and forms
the basin of a drainage-area of between 200,000 and 300,000
acres, receiving a rainfall of 54,000,000 tons, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
must be raised 16 feet in discharging it. The beds of these
lakes are from 10 to 20 feet lower than the water-level in
the adjacent canals. In 1840, 12,000 windmills were still
employed in this work. In the following year, William II.,
at the suggestion of a commission, decreed that only steam-engines
should be employed to do this immense work. Up
to this time the average consumption of fuel for the pumping-engines
in use is said to have been 20 pounds per hour
per horse-power.</p>

<p>The first engine used was erected in 1777 and 1778, on
the Newcomen plan, to assist the 34 windmills employed to
drain a lake near Rotterdam. This lake covered 7,000
acres, and its bed was 12 feet below the surface of the
river Meuse, which passes it, and empties into the sea in the
immediate neighborhood. The iron parts of the engine
were built in England, and the machine was put together in
Holland. The steam-cylinder was 52 inches in diameter,
and the stroke of piston 9 feet. The boiler was 18 feet in
diameter, and contained a double flue. The main beam was
27 feet long. The pumps were 6 in number, 3 cylindrical
and 3 having a square cross-section; 3 were of 6 feet and
3 of 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet stroke. Two pumps only were worked at high-tide,
and the others were added one at a time, as the tide
fell, until, at low-tide, all 6 were at work.</p>

<p>The size of this engine, and the magnitude of its
work, seem insignificant when compared with the machinery
installed 60 years later to drain the Haarlemmer Meer, and
with the work done by the last. These engines are 12 feet
in diameter of cylinder and 10 feet stroke of piston, and
work&mdash;they are 3 in number&mdash;the one 11 pumps of 63 inches
diameter and 10 feet stroke, the others 8 pumps of
73 inches diameter and of the same length of stroke. The
modern engines do a &#8220;duty&#8221; of 75,000,000 to 87,000,000
with 94 pounds of coal, consuming 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pounds of coal per
hour and per horse-power.</p>

<p>The first steam-engine applied to working the blowing-machinery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of a blast-furnace was erected at the Carron
Iron-Works, in Scotland, near Falkirk, in 1765, and proved
very unsatisfactory. Smeaton subsequently, in 1769 or
1770, introduced better machinery into these works and
improved the old engine, and this use of the steam-engine
soon became usual. This engine did its work indirectly,
furnishing water, by pumping, to drive the water-wheels
which worked the blowing-cylinders. Its steam-cylinder
was 6 feet in diameter, and the pump-cylinder 52 inches.
The stroke was 9 feet.</p>

<p>A direct-acting engine, used as a blowing-engine, was not
constructed until about 1784, at which time a single-acting
blowing-cylinder, or air-pump, was placed at the &#8220;out-board&#8221;
end of the beam, where the pump-rod had been
attached. The piston of the air-cylinder was loaded with
the weights needed to force it down, expelling the air, and
the engine did its work in raising the loaded piston, the air-cylinder
filling as the piston rose. A large &#8220;accumulator&#8221;
was used to equalize the pressure of the expelled air. This
consisted of another air-cylinder, having a loaded piston
which was left free to rise and fall. At each expulsion of
air by the blowing-engine this cylinder was filled, the loaded
piston rising to the top. While the piston of the former
was returning, and the air-cylinder was taking in its charge
of air, the accumulator would gradually discharge the
stored air, the piston slowly falling under its load. This
piston was called the &#8220;floating piston,&#8221; or &#8220;fly-piston,&#8221; and
its action was, in effect, precisely that of the upper portion
of the common blacksmith&#8217;s bellows.</p>

<p>Dr. Robison, the author of &#8220;Mechanical Philosophy,&#8221;
one of the very few works even now existing deserving such
a title, describes one of these engines<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
as working in Scotland
in 1790. It had a steam-cylinder 40 or 44 inches in
diameter, a blowing-cylinder 60 inches in diameter, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
stroke of piston was 6 feet. The air-pressure was 2.77
pounds per square inch as a maximum in the blowing-cylinder;
and the floating piston in the regulating-cylinder was
loaded with 2.63 pounds per square inch. Making 15 or
18 strokes per minute, this engine delivered about 1,600
cubic feet of air, or 120<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> pounds in weight, per minute,
and developed 20 horse-power.</p>

<p>At about the same date a change was made in the blowing-cylinder.
The air entered at the bottom, as before, but
was forced out at the top, the piston being fitted with
valves, as in the common lifting-pump, and the engine thus
being arranged to do the work of expulsion during the
down-stroke of the steam-piston.</p>

<p>Four years later, the regulating-cylinder, or accumulator,
was given up, and the now familiar &#8220;water-regulator&#8221;
was substituted for it. This consists of a tank, usually of
sheet-iron, set open-end downward in a large vessel containing
water. The lower edge of the inner tank is supported
on piers a few inches above the bottom of the large
one. The pipe carrying air from the blowing-engine passes
above this water-regulator, and a branch-pipe is led down
into the inner tank. As the air-pressure varies, the level of
the water within the inverted tank changes, rising as pressure
falls at the slowing of the motion of the piston, and
falling as the pressure rises again while the piston is moving
with an accelerated velocity. The regulator, thus receiving
surplus air to be delivered when needed, greatly assists in
regulating the pressure. The larger the regulator, the more
perfectly uniform the pressure. The water-level outside
the inner tank is usually five or six feet higher than within
it. This apparatus was found much more satisfactory than
the previously-used regulator, and, with its introduction, the
establishment of the steam-engine as a blowing-engine for
iron-works and at blast-furnaces may be considered as having
been fully established.</p>

<p>Thus, by the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
century, the steam-engine had become generally introduced,
and had been applied to nearly all of the purposes for which
a single-acting engine could be used. The path which had
been opened by Worcester had been fairly laid out by Savery
and his contemporaries, and the builders of the Newcomen
engine, with such improvements as they had been able to effect,
had followed it as far as they were able. The real and
practical introduction of the steam-engine is as fairly attributable
to Smeaton as to any one of the inventors whose
names are more generally known in connection with it. As
a mechanic, he was unrivaled; as an engineer, he was head
and shoulders above any constructor of his time engaged in
general practice. There were very few important public
works built in Great Britain at that time in relation to
which he was not consulted; and he was often visited by
foreign engineers, who desired his advice with regard to
works in progress on the Continent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The world is now entering upon the Mechanical Epoch. There is nothing
in the future more sure than the great triumphs which that epoch is to
achieve. It has already advanced to some glorious conquests. What miracles
of invention now crowd upon us! Look abroad, and contemplate the

<p>The success of the Newcomen engine naturally attracted
the attention of mechanics, and of scientific men as well, to
the possibility of making other applications of steam-power.</p>

<p>The best men of the time gave much attention to the
subject, but, until James Watt began the work that has
made him famous, nothing more was done than to improve
the proportions and slightly alter the details of the Newcomen
and Calley engine, even by such skillful engineers as
Brindley and Smeaton. Of the personal history of the
earlier inventors and improvers of the steam-engine, very
little is ascertained; but that of Watt has become well
known.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Port4" id="Port4"></a>

<p class="caption">James Watt.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Port4">James Watt</a></span> was of an humble lineage, and was born
at Greenock, then a little Scotch fishing village, but now
a considerable and a busy town, which annually launches
upon the waters of the Clyde a fleet of steamships whose
engines are probably, in the aggregate, far more powerful
than were all the engines in the world at the date of Watt&#8217;s
birth, January 19, 1736. His grandfather, Thomas Watt,
of Crawfordsdyke, near Greenock, was a well-known mathematician
about the year 1700, and was for many years a
schoolmaster at that place. His father was a prominent
citizen of Greenock, and was at various times chief magistrate
and treasurer of the town. James Watt was a bright
boy, but exceedingly delicate in health, and quite unable to
attend school regularly, or to apply himself closely to either
study or play. His early education was given by his parents,
who were respectable and intelligent people, and the
tools borrowed from his father&#8217;s carpenter-bench served at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
once to amuse him and to give him a dexterity and familiarity
with their use that must undoubtedly have been of
inestimable value to him in after-life.</p>

<p>M. Arago, the eminent French philosopher, who wrote
one of the earliest and most interesting biographies of
Watt, relates anecdotes of him which, if correct, illustrate
well his thoughtfulness and his intelligence, as well as the
mechanical bent of the boy&#8217;s mind. He is said, at the age
of six years, to have occupied himself during leisure hours
with the solution of geometrical problems; and Arago discovers,
in a story in which he is described as experimenting
with the tea-kettle,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
his earliest investigations of the nature
and properties of steam.</p>

<p>When finally sent to the village school, his ill health
prevented his making rapid progress; and it was only
when thirteen or fourteen years of age that he began to
show that he was capable of taking the lead in his class, and
to exhibit his ability in the study, particularly, of mathematics.
His spare time was principally spent in sketching
with his pencil, in carving, and in working at the bench,
both in wood and metal. He made many ingenious pieces
of mechanism, and some beautiful models. His favorite
work seemed to be the repairing of nautical instruments.
Among other pieces of apparatus made by the boy was
a very fine barrel-organ. In boyhood, as in after-life, he
was a diligent reader, and seemed to find something to interest
him in every book that came into his hands.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen, Watt was sent to Glasgow, there
to reside with his mother&#8217;s relatives, and to learn the trade
of a mathematical-instrument maker. The mechanic with
whom he was placed was soon found too indolent, or was
otherwise incapable of giving much aid in the project, and
Dr. Dick, of the University of Glasgow, with whom Watt
became acquainted, advised him to go to London. Accordingly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he set out in June, 1755, for the metropolis, where, on
his arrival, he arranged with Mr. John Morgan, in Cornhill,
to work a year at his chosen business, receiving as compensation
20 guineas. At the end of the year he was compelled,
by serious ill-health, to return home.</p>

<p>Having become restored to health, he went again to
Glasgow in 1756, with the intention of pursuing his calling
there. But, not being the son of a burgess, and not having
served his apprenticeship in the town, he was forbidden by
the guilds, or trades-unions, to open a shop in Glasgow.
Dr. Dick came to his aid, and employed him to repair some
apparatus which had been bequeathed to the college. He
was finally allowed the use of three rooms in the University
building, its authorities not being under the municipal rule.
He remained here until 1760, when, the trades no longer
objecting, he took a shop in the city; and in 1761 moved
again, into a shop on the north side of the Trongate, where
he earned a scanty living without molestation, and still
kept up his connection with the college. He did some work
as a civil engineer in the neighborhood of Glasgow, but
soon gave up all other employment, and devoted himself
entirely to mechanics.</p>

<p>He spent much of his leisure time&mdash;of which he had, at
first, more than was desirable&mdash;in making philosophical experiments
and in the manufacture of musical instruments,
in making himself familiar with the sciences, and in devising
improvements in the construction of organs. In order
to pursue his researches more satisfactorily, he studied German
and Italian, and read Smith&#8217;s &#8220;Harmonics,&#8221; that he
might become familiar with the principles of construction of
musical instruments. His reading was still very desultory;
but the introduction of the Newcomen engine in the neighborhood
of Glasgow, and the presence of a model in the
college collections, which was placed in his hands, in 1763,
for repair, led him to study the history of the steam-engine,
and to conduct for himself an experimental research<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
into the properties of steam, with a set of improvised apparatus.</p>

<p>Dr. Robison, then a student of the University, who
found Watt&#8217;s shop a pleasant place in which to spend his
leisure, and whose tastes affiliated so strongly with those of
Watt that they became friends immediately upon making
acquaintance, called the attention of the instrument-maker
to the steam-engine as early as 1759, and suggested that it
might be applied to the propulsion of carriages. Watt was
at once interested, and went to work on a little model, having
tin steam-cylinders and pistons connected to the driving-wheels
by an intermediate system of gearing. The scheme
was afterwards given up, and was not revived by Watt for a
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Watt studied chemistry, and was assisted by the advice
and instruction of Dr. Black, who was then making the researches
which resulted in the discovery of &#8220;latent heat.&#8221;
His proposal to repair the model Newcomen engine in the
college collections led to his study of Desaguliers&#8217;s treatise,
and of the works of Switzer and others. He thus learned
what had been done by Savery and by Newcomen, and
by those who had improved the engine of the latter.</p>

<p>In his own experiments he used, at first, apothecaries&#8217;
phials and hollow canes for steam reservoirs and pipes, and
later a Papin&#8217;s digester and a common syringe. The latter
combination made a non-condensing engine, in which he
used steam at a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch.
The valve was worked by hand, and Watt saw that an
automatic valve-gear only was needed to make a working
machine. This experiment, however, led to no practical result.
He finally took hold of the Newcomen model, which
had been obtained from London, where it had been sent
for repairs, and, putting it in good working order, commenced
experiments with that.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig24" id="Fig24"></a>
<img src="images/illo111.png" alt="Newcomen Model" width="252" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>&mdash;The Newcomen Model.</p></div>

<p>The Newcomen model, as it happened, had a boiler
which, although made to a scale from engines in actual use,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was quite incapable of furnishing steam enough to work the
engine. It was about nine inches in diameter; the steam-cylinder
was two inches in diameter, and of six inches stroke
of piston, arranged as in <a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>, which is a picture of the
model as it now appears. It is retained among the most
carefully-preserved treasures of the University of Glasgow.</p>

<p>Watt made a new boiler for the experimental investigation
on which he was about to enter, and arranged it in such
a manner that he could measure the quantity of water evaporated
and of steam used at every stroke of the engine.</p>

<p>He soon discovered that it required but a very small
quantity of steam to heat a very large quantity of water,
and immediately attempted to determine with precision the
relative weights of steam and water in the steam-cylinder
when condensation took place at the down-stroke of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
engine, and thus independently proved the existence of that
&#8220;latent heat,&#8221; the discovery of which constitutes, also, one
of the greatest of Dr. Black&#8217;s claims to distinction. Watt
at once went to Dr. Black and related the remarkable fact
which he had thus detected, and was, in turn, taught by
Black the character of the phenomenon as it had been explained
to his classes by the latter some little time previously.
Watt found that, at the boiling-point, his steam, condensing,
was capable of heating six times its weight of
water such as was used for producing condensation.</p>

<p>Perceiving that steam, weight for weight even, was a
vastly greater absorbent and reservoir of heat than water,
Watt saw plainly the importance of taking greater care to
economize it than had previously been customary. He first
attempted to economize in the boiler, and made boilers with
wooden &#8220;shells,&#8221; in order to prevent losses by conduction
and radiation, and used a larger number of flues to secure
more complete absorption of the heat from the furnace-gases.
He also covered his steam-pipes with non-conducting
materials, and took every precaution that his ingenuity
could devise to secure complete utilization of the heat of
combustion. He soon found, however, that he was not
working at the most important point, and that the great
source of loss was to be found in defects which he noted in
the action of the steam in the cylinder. He soon concluded
that the sources of loss of heat in the Newcomen engine&mdash;which
would be greatly exaggerated in a small model&mdash;were:</p>

<p>First, the dissipation of heat by the cylinder itself,
which was of brass, and was both a good conductor and a
good radiator.</p>

<p>Secondly, the loss of heat consequent upon the necessity
of cooling down the cylinder at every stroke, in producing
the vacuum.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the loss of power due to the pressure of vapor
beneath the piston, which was a consequence of the imperfect
method of condensation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>He first made a cylinder of non-conducting material&mdash;wood
soaked in oil and then baked&mdash;and obtained a decided
advantage in economy of steam. He then conducted
a series of very accurate experiments upon the temperature
and pressure of steam at such points on the scale as he could
readily reach, and, constructing a curve with his results,
the abscesses representing temperatures and the pressures
being represented by the ordinates, he ran the curve backward
until he had obtained closely-approximate measures of
temperatures less than 212&deg;, and pressures less than atmospheric.
He thus found that, with the amount of injection-water
used in the Newcomen engine, bringing the temperature
of the interior, as he found, down to from 140&deg; to 175&deg;
Fahr., a very considerable back-pressure would be met with.</p>

<p>Continuing his examination still further, he measured
the amount of steam used at each stroke, and, comparing it
with the quantity that would just fill the cylinder, he found
that at least <i>three-fourths was wasted</i>. The quantity of
cold water necessary to produce the condensation of a given
weight of steam was next determined; and he found that
one pound of steam contained enough heat to raise about
six pounds of cold water, as used for condensation, from the
temperature of 52&deg; to the boiling-point; and, going still
further, he found that he was compelled to use, at each
stroke of the Newcomen engine, <i>four times as much injection-water
as should suffice to condense a cylinder full of
steam</i>. This confirmed his previous conclusion that three-fourths
of the heat supplied to the engine was wasted.</p>

<p>Watt had now, therefore, determined by his own researches,
as he himself enumerates them,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the following
facts:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. The capacities for heat of iron, copper, and of
some sorts of wood, as compared with water.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. The bulk of steam compared with that of water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;3. The quantity of water evaporated in a certain
boiler by a pound of coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. The elasticities of steam at various temperatures
greater than that of boiling water, and an approximation to
the law which it follows at other temperatures.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. How much water in the form of steam was required
every stroke by a small Newcomen engine, with a
wooden cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 12 inches stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;6. The quantity of cold water required in every stroke
to condense the steam in that cylinder, so as to give it a
working-power of about 7 pounds on the square inch.&#8221;</p>

<p>After these well-devised and truly scientific investigations,
Watt was enabled to enter upon his work of improving
the steam-engine with an intelligent understanding of
its existing defects, and with a knowledge of their cause.
Watt soon saw that, in order to reduce the losses in the
working of the steam in the steam-cylinder, it would be
necessary to find some means, as he said, to keep the cylinder
&#8220;always as hot as the steam that entered it,&#8221; notwithstanding
the great fluctuations of temperature and pressure
of the steam during the up and the down strokes. He has
told us how, finally, the happy thought occurred to him
which relieved him of all difficulty, and led to the series of
modifications which at last gave to the world the modern
type of steam-engine.</p>

<p>He says:<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
&#8220;I had gone to take a walk on a fine Sabbath
afternoon. I had entered the Green by the gate at
the foot of Charlotte street, and had passed the old washing-house.
I was thinking upon the engine at the time,
and had gone as far as the herd&#8217;s house, when the idea came
into my mind that, as steam was an elastic body, it would
rush into a vacuum, and, if a communication were made between
the cylinder and an exhausted vessel, it would rush
into it, and might be there condensed without cooling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
cylinder. I then saw that I must get rid of the condensed
steam and injection-water if I used a jet, as in Newcomen&#8217;s
engine. Two ways of doing this occurred to me: First,
the water might be run off by a descending pipe, if an offlet
could be got at the depth of 35 or 36 feet, and any air
might be extracted by a small pump. The second was, to
make the pump large enough to extract both water and air.&#8221;
&#8220;I had not walked farther than the Golf-house, when the
whole thing was arranged in my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Referring to this invention, Watt said to Prof. Jardine:<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
&#8220;When analyzed, the invention would not appear so great
as it seemed to be. In the state in which I found the
steam-engine, it was no great effort of mind to observe that
the quantity of fuel necessary to make it work would
forever prevent its extensive utility. The next step in
my progress was equally easy&mdash;to inquire what was the
cause of the great consumption of fuel. This, too, was
readily suggested, viz., the waste of fuel which was necessary
to bring the whole cylinder, piston, and adjacent parts
from the coldness of water to the heat of steam, no fewer
than from 15 to 20 times in a minute.&#8221; It was by pursuing
this train of thought that he was led to devise the separate
condenser.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig25" id="Fig25"></a>
<img src="images/illo116.png" alt="Watt's Experiment" width="311" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>&mdash;Watt&#8217;s Experiment.</p></div>

<p>On Monday morning Watt proceeded to make an experimental
test of his new invention, using for his steam-cylinder
and piston a large brass surgeon&#8217;s-syringe, 1<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>-inch
diameter and 10 inches long. At each end was a pipe leading
steam from the boiler, and fitted with a cock to act as
a steam-valve. A pipe led also from the top of the cylinder
to the condenser, the syringe being inverted and the
piston-rod hanging downward for convenience. The condenser
was made of two pipes of thin tin plate, 10 or 12
inches long, and about one-sixth of an inch in diameter,
standing vertically, and having a connection at the top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with a horizontal pipe of larger size, and fitted with a
&#8220;snifting-valve.&#8221; Another vertical pipe, about an inch in
diameter, was connected to the condenser, and was fitted
with a piston, with a view to using it as an &#8220;air-pump.&#8221;
The whole was set in a cistern of cold water. The piston-rod
of the little steam-cylinder was drilled from end to end
to permit the water to be removed from the cylinder. This
little model (<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>) worked very satisfactorily, and the
perfection of the vacuum was such that the machine lifted
a weight of 18 pounds hung upon the piston-rod, as in the
sketch. A larger model was immediately afterward constructed,
and the result of its test confirmed fully the anticipations
which had been awakened by the first experiment.</p>

<p>Having taken this first step and made such a radical
improvement, the success of this invention was no sooner
determined than others followed in rapid succession, as consequences
of the exigencies arising from the first change in
the old Newcomen engine. But in the working out of the
forms and proportions of the details of the new engine,
even Watt&#8217;s powerful mind, stored as it was with happily-combined
scientific and practical information, was occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
for years. In attaching the separate condenser, he first
attempted surface-condensation; but this not succeeding
well, he substituted the jet. Some provision became at
once necessary for preventing the filling of the condenser
with water.</p>

<p>Watt at first intended adopting the expedient which had
worked satisfactorily with the less effective condensation of
Newcomen&#8217;s engine&mdash;i. e., leading a pipe from the condenser
to a depth greater than the height of a column of water
which could be counterbalanced by the pressure of the
atmosphere; but he subsequently employed the air-pump,
which relieves the condenser not only of the water, but of
the air which also usually collects in considerable volume in
the condenser, and vitiates the vacuum. He next substituted
oil and tallow for water in the lubrication of the piston and
keeping it steam-tight, in order to avoid the cooling of the
cylinder incident to the use of the latter. Another cause
of refrigeration of the cylinder, and consequent waste of
power in its operation, was seen to be the entrance of the
atmosphere, which followed the piston down the cylinder at
each stroke, cooling its interior by its contact. This the
inventor concluded to prevent by covering the top of the
cylinder, allowing the piston-rod to play through a &#8220;stuffing-box&#8221;&mdash;which
device had long been known to mechanics.</p>

<p>He accordingly not only covered the top, but surrounded
the whole cylinder with an external casing, or
&#8220;steam-jacket,&#8221; and allowed the steam from the boiler to
pass around the steam-cylinder and to press upon the upper
surface of the piston, where its pressure was variable at
pleasure, and therefore more manageable than that of the
atmosphere. It also, besides keeping the cylinder hot,
could do comparatively little harm should it leak by the
piston, as it could be condensed, and thus readily disposed of.</p>

<p>When he had concluded to build the larger experimental
engine, Watt determined to give his whole time and attention
to the work, and hired a room in an old deserted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
pottery near the Broomielaw. Here he worked with a
mechanic&mdash;John Gardiner, whom he had taken into his employ&mdash;uninterruptedly
for many weeks. Meantime, through
his friend Dr. Black, probably, he had made the acquaintance
of Dr. Roebuck, a wealthy physician, who had, with
other Scotch capitalists, just founded the celebrated Carron
Iron-Works, and had opened a correspondence with him, in
which he kept that gentleman informed of the progress of
his work on the new engine.</p>

<p>This engine had a steam-cylinder, Watt tells us, of &#8220;five
or six&#8221; inches diameter, and of two feet stroke. It was of
copper, smooth-hammered, but not bored out, and &#8220;not
very true.&#8221; This was encased in another cylinder of wood.
In August, 1765, he tried the small engine, and wrote Dr.
Roebuck that he had had &#8220;good success,&#8221; although the
machine was very imperfect. &#8220;On turning the exhausting-cock,
the piston, when not loaded, ascended as quick as
the blow of a hammer, and as quick when loaded with 18
pounds (being 7 pounds on the inch) as it would have done
if it had had an injection as usual.&#8221; He then tells his
correspondent that he was about to make the larger model.
In October, 1765, he finished the latter. The engine, when
ready for trial, was still very imperfect. It nevertheless did
good work for so rude a machine.</p>

<p>Watt was now reduced to poverty, and, after borrowing
considerable sums from friends, he was finally compelled to
give up his scheme for the time, and to seek employment in
order to provide for his family. During an interval of about
two years he supported himself by surveying, and by the
work of exploring coal-fields in the neighborhood of Glasgow
for the magistrates of the city. He did not, however,
entirely give up his invention.</p>

<p>In 1767, Dr. Roebuck assumed Watt&#8217;s liabilities to the
amount of &pound;1,000, and agreed to provide capital for the prosecution
of his experiments and to introduce his invention;
and, on the other hand, Watt agreed to surrender to Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Roebuck two-thirds of the patent. Another engine was
next built, having a steam-cylinder seven or eight inches
in diameter, which was finished in 1768. This worked sufficiently
well to induce the partners to ask for a patent, and
the specifications and drawings were completed and presented
in 1769.</p>

<p>Watt also built and set up several Newcomen engines,
partly, perhaps, to make himself thus thoroughly familiar
with the practical details of engine-building. Meantime,
also, he prepared the plans for, and finally had built, a moderately
large engine of his own new type. Its steam-cylinder
was 18 inches in diameter, and the stroke of piston was
5 feet. This engine was built at Kinneil, and was finished
in September, 1769. It was not all satisfactory in either
its construction or its operation. The condenser was a
surface-condenser composed of pipes somewhat like that
used in his first little model, and did not prove to be satisfactorily
tight. The steam-piston leaked seriously, and repeated
trials only served to make more evident its imperfections.
He was assisted in this time of need by both Dr. Black and
Dr. Roebuck; but he felt strongly the risks which he ran
of involving his friends in serious losses, and became very
despondent. Writing to Dr. Black, he says: &#8220;Of all
things in life, there is nothing more foolish than inventing;&#8221;
and probably the majority of inventors have been led to the
same opinion by their own experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misfortunes never come singly;&#8221; and Watt was borne
down by the greatest of all misfortunes&mdash;the loss of a faithful
and affectionate wife&mdash;while still unable to see a successful
issue of his schemes. Only less disheartening than
this was the loss of fortune of his steadfast friend, Dr. Roebuck,
and the consequent loss of his aid. It was at about
this time, in the year 1769, that negotiations were commenced
which resulted in the transfer of the capitalized interest
in Watt&#8217;s engine to the wealthy manufacturer whose
name, coupled with that of Watt, afterward became known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
throughout the civilized world, as the steam-engine in its
new form was pushed into use by his energy and business
tact.</p>

<p>Watt met Mr. Boulton, who next became his partner, in
1768, on his journey to London to procure his patent, and
the latter had then examined Watt&#8217;s designs, and, at once
perceiving their value, proposed to purchase an interest.
Watt was then unable to reply definitely to Boulton&#8217;s proposition,
pending his business arrangements with Dr. Roebuck;
but, with Roebuck&#8217;s consent, afterwards proposed
that Boulton should take a one-third interest with himself
and partner, paying Roebuck therefor one-half of all expenses
previously incurred, and whatever he should choose
to add to compensate &#8220;for the risk he had run.&#8221; Subsequently,
Dr. Roebuck proposed to transfer to Boulton and
to Dr. Small, who was desirous of taking interest with
Boulton, one-half of his proprietorship in Watt&#8217;s inventions,
on receiving &#8220;a sum not less than one thousand pounds,&#8221;
which should, after the experiments on the engine were
completed, be deemed &#8220;just and reasonable.&#8221; Twelve
months were allowed for the adjustment of the account.
This proposal was accepted in November, 1769.</p>

<p class="caption">Matthew Boulton.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Port5">Matthew Boulton</a></span>, who now became a partner with
James Watt, was the son of a Birmingham silver stamper
and piecer, and succeeded to his father&#8217;s business, building
up a great establishment, which, as well as its proprietor,
was well known in Watt&#8217;s time. Watt, writing to Dr.
Roebuck before the final arrangement had been made,
urged him to close with Boulton for &#8220;the following considerations:</p>

<p>&#8220;1st. From Mr. Boulton&#8217;s own character as an ingenious,
honest, and rich man. 2dly. From the difficulty and
expense there would be of procuring accurate and honest
workmen and providing them with proper utensils, and
getting a proper overseer or overseers. If, to avoid this
inconvenience, you were to contract for the work to be done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by a master-workman, you must give up a great share of
the profit. 3dly. The success of the engine is far from
being verified. If Mr. Boulton takes his chance of success
from the account I shall write Dr. Small, and pays you
any adequate share of the money laid out, it lessens your risk,
and in a greater proportion than I think it will lessen your
profits. 4thly. The assistance of Mr. Boulton&#8217;s and Dr.
Small&#8217;s ingenuity (if the latter engage in it) in improving
and perfecting the machine may be very considerable, and
may enable us to get the better of the difficulties that might
otherwise damn it. Lastly, consider my uncertain health,
my irresolute and inactive disposition, my inability to bargain
and struggle for my own with mankind: all which
disqualify me for any great undertaking. On our side,
consider the first outlay and interest, the patent, the present
engine, about &pound;200 (though there would not be much loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in making it into a common engine), two years of my time,
and the expense of models.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watt&#8217;s estimate of the value of Boulton&#8217;s ingenuity and
talent was well-founded. Boulton had shown himself a good
scholar, and had acquired considerable knowledge of the
languages and of the sciences, particularly of mathematics,
after leaving the school from which he graduated into the
shop when still a boy. In the shop he soon introduced
a number of valuable improvements, and he was always
on the lookout for improvements made by others, with a
view to their introduction in his business. He was a man
of the modern style, and never permitted competitors to
excel him in any respect, without the strongest efforts to
retain his leading position. He always aimed to earn a
reputation for good work, as well as to make money. His
father&#8217;s workshop was at Birmingham; but Boulton, after a
time, found that his rapidly-increasing business would compel
him to find room for the erection of a more extensive
establishment, and he secured land at Soho, two miles distant
from Birmingham, and there erected his new manufactory,
about 1762.</p>

<p>The business was, at first, the manufacture of ornamental
metal-ware, such as metal buttons, buckles, watch-chains,
and light filigree and inlaid work. The manufacture of
gold and silver plated-ware was soon added, and this branch
of business gradually developed into a very extensive manufacture
of works of art. Boulton copied fine work wherever
he could find it, and often borrowed vases, statuettes,
and bronzes of all kinds from the nobility of England, and
even from the queen, from which to make copies. The
manufacture of inexpensive clocks, such as are now well
known throughout the world as an article of American trade,
was begun by Boulton. He made some fine astronomical
and valuable ornamental clocks, which were better appreciated
on the Continent than in England. The business of
the Soho manufactory in a few years became so extensive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that its goods were known to every civilized nation, and its
growth, under the management of the enterprising, conscientious,
and ingenious Boulton, more than kept pace with
the accumulation of capital; and the proprietor found himself,
by his very prosperity, often driven to the most careful
manipulation of his assets, and to making free use of
his credit.</p>

<p>Boulton had a remarkable talent for making valuable
acquaintances, and for making the most of advantages accruing
thereby. In 1758 he made the acquaintance of
Benjamin Franklin, who then visited Soho; and in 1766
these distinguished men, who were then unaware of the
existence of James Watt, were corresponding, and, in their
letters, discussing the applicability of steam-power to various
useful purposes. Between the two a new steam-engine was
designed, and a model was constructed by Boulton, which
was sent to Franklin and exhibited by him in London.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin seems to have had something to do with
this scheme, and the enthusiasm awakened by the promise
of success given by this model may have been the origin of
the now celebrated prophetic rhymes so often quoted from
the works of that eccentric physician and poet. Franklin
contributed, as his share in the plan, an idea of so arranging
the grate as to prevent the production of smoke. He says:
&#8220;All that is necessary is to make the smoke of fresh coals
pass descending through those that are already ignited.&#8221;
His idea has been, by more recent schemers, repeatedly
brought forward as new. Nothing resulted from these experiments
of Boulton, Franklin, and Darwin, and the plan
of Watt soon superseded all less well-developed plans.</p>

<p>In 1767, Watt visited Soho and carefully inspected
Boulton&#8217;s establishment. He was very favorably impressed
by the admirable arrangement of the workshops and the
completeness of their outfit, as well as by the perfection of
the organization and administration of the business. In
the following year he again visited Soho, and this time met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Boulton, who had been absent at the previous visit. The
two great mechanics were mutually gratified by the meeting,
and each at once acquired for the other the greatest
respect and esteem. They discussed Watt&#8217;s plans, and
Boulton then definitely decided not to continue his own
experiments, although he had actually commenced the construction
of a pumping-engine. With Dr. Small, who was
also at Soho, Watt discussed the possibility of applying his
engine to the propulsion of carriages, and to other purposes.
On his return home, Watt continued his desultory labors
on his engines, as already described; and the final completion
of the arrangement with Boulton, which immediately
followed the failure of Dr. Roebuck, took place some time
later.</p>

<p>Before Watt could leave Scotland to join his partner at
Soho, it was necessary that he should finish the work which
he had in hand, including the surveys of the Caledonian
canal, and other smaller works, which he had had in progress
some months. He reached Birmingham in the spring of
1774, and was at once domiciled at Soho, where he set at
work upon the partly-made engines which had been sent
from Scotland some time previously. They had laid, unused
and exposed to the weather, at Kinneil three years, and
were not in as good order as might have been desired. The
<i>block-tin</i> steam-cylinder was probably in good condition,
but the iron parts were, as Watt said, &#8220;perishing,&#8221; while
he had been engaged in his civil engineering work. At
leisure moments, during this period, Watt had not entirely
neglected his plans for the utilization of steam. He had
given much thought, and had expended some time, in experiments
upon the plan of using it in a rotary or &#8220;wheel&#8221;
engine. He did not succeed in contriving any plan which
seemed to promise success.</p>

<p>It was in November, 1774, that Watt finally announced
to his old partner, Dr. Roebuck, the successful trial of the
Kinneil engine. He did not write with the usual enthusiasm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and extravagance of the inventor, for his frequent disappointments
and prolonged suspense had very thoroughly
extinguished his vivacity. He simply wrote: &#8220;The fire-engine
I have invented is now going, and answers much
better than any other that has yet been made; and I expect
that the invention will be very beneficial to me.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig26" id="Fig26"></a>
<img src="images/illo125.png" alt="Watt's Engine" width="350" height="531" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Watt&#8217;s Engine, 1774.</p></div>

<p>The change of the &#8220;atmospheric engine&#8221; of Newcomen
into the modern steam-engine was now completed in its
essential details. The first engine which was erected at
Kinneil, near Boroughstoness, had a steam-cylinder 18
inches in diameter. It is seen in the accompanying sketch.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>, the steam passes from the boiler through the
pipe <i>d</i> and the valve <i>c</i> to the cylinder-casing or steam-jacket,
<i>Y Y</i>, and above the piston, <i>b</i>, which it follows in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
descent in the cylinder, <i>a</i>, the valve <i>f</i> being at this time
open, to allow the exhaust into the condenser, <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>The piston now being at the lower end of the cylinder,
and the pump-rods at the opposite end of the beam, <i>y</i>, being
thus raised and the pumps filled with water, the valves <i>c</i>
and <i>f</i> close, while <i>e</i> opens, allowing the steam which remains
above the piston to flow beneath it, until, the pressures
becoming equal above and below, the weight of the pump-rods
overbalancing that of the piston, the latter is rapidly
drawn to the top of the cylinder, while the steam is displaced
above, passing to the under-side of the piston.</p>

<p>The valve <i>e</i> is next closed, and <i>c</i> and <i>f</i> are again opened;
the down-stroke is repeated. The water and air entering
the condenser are removed at each stroke by the air-pump,
<i>i</i>, which communicates with the condenser by the passage <i>s</i>.
The pump <i>q</i> supplies condensing-water, and the pump <i>A</i>
takes away a part of the water of condensation, which is
thrown by the air-pump into the &#8220;hot-well,&#8221; <i>k</i>, and from
it the feed-pump supplies the boiler. The valves are
moved by valve-gear very similar to Beighton&#8217;s and Smeaton&#8217;s,
by the pins, <i>m m</i>, in the &#8220;plug-frame&#8221; or &#8220;tappet-rod,&#8221;
<i>n n</i>.</p>

<p>The engine is mounted upon a substantial foundation,
<i>B B</i>. <i>F</i> is an opening out of which, before starting the
engine, the air is driven from the cylinder and condenser.</p>

<p>The inventions covered by the patent of 1769 were described
as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;My method of lessening the consumption of steam,
and consequently fuel, in fire-engines, consists in the following
principles:</p>

<p>&#8220;1st. That the vessel in which the powers of steam are
to be employed to work the engine&mdash;which is called &#8216;the
cylinder&#8217; in common fire-engines, and which I call &#8216;the
steam-vessel&#8217;&mdash;must, during the whole time that the engine
is at work, be kept as hot as the steam which enters it; first,
by inclosing it in a case of wood, or any other materials that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
transmit heat slowly; secondly, by surrounding it with
steam or other heated bodies; and thirdly, by suffering
neither water nor other substances colder than the steam to
enter or touch it during that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;2dly. In engines that are to be worked, wholly or partially,
by condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed
in vessels distinct from the steam-vessel or cylinder,
though occasionally communicating with them. These vessels
I call condensers; and while the engines are working,
these <i>condensers</i> ought at least to be kept as cold as the air
in the neighborhood of the engines, by application of water
or other cold bodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;3dly. Whatever air or other elastic vapor is not condensed
by the cold of the condenser, and may impede the
working of the engine, is to be drawn out of the steam-vessels
or condensers by means of pumps, wrought by the engines
themselves, or otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;4thly. I intend in many cases to employ the expansive
force of steam to press on the pistons, or whatever may be
used instead of them, in the same manner as the pressure
of the atmosphere is now employed in common fire-engines.
In cases where cold water cannot be had in plenty, the
engines may be wrought by this force of steam only, by
discharging the steam into the open air after it has done its
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;5thly. Where motions round an axis are required, I
make the steam-vessels in form of hollow rings or circular
channels, with proper inlets and outlets for the steam,
mounted on horizontal axles like the wheels of a water-mill.
Within them are placed a number of valves that suffer any
body to go round the channel in one direction only. In
these steam-vessels are placed weights, so fitted to them as
to fill up a part or portion of their channels, yet rendered
capable of moving freely in them by the means hereinafter
mentioned or specified. When the steam is admitted in
these engines between these weights and the valves, it acts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
equally on both, so as to raise the weight on one side of the
wheel, and, by the reaction of the valves successively, to
give a circular motion to the wheel, the valves opening in
the direction in which the weights are pressed, but not in
the contrary. As the vessel moves round, it is supplied
with steam from the boiler, and that which has performed
its office may either be discharged by means of condensers,
or into the open air.</p>

<p>&#8220;6thly. I intend in some cases to apply a degree of
cold not capable of reducing the steam to water, but of contracting
it considerably, so that the engines shall be worked
by the alternate expansion and contraction of the steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lastly, instead of using water to render the piston or
other parts of the engine air or steam-tight, I employ oils,
wax, resinous bodies, fat of animals, quicksilver, and other
metals, in their fluid state.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the construction and erection of his engines, Watt
still had great difficulty in finding skillful workmen to make
the parts with accuracy, to fit them with care, and to erect
them properly when once finished. And the fact that both
Newcomen and Watt met with such serious trouble, indicates
that, even had the engine been designed earlier, it is
quite unlikely that the world would have seen the steam-engine
a success until this time, when mechanics were just
acquiring the skill requisite for its construction. But, on
the other hand, it is not at all improbable that, had the mechanics
of an earlier period been as skillful and as well-educated
in the manual niceties of their business, the steam-engine
might have been much earlier brought into use.</p>

<p>In the time of the Marquis of Worcester it would have
probably been found impossible to obtain workmen to construct
the steam-engine of Watt, had it been then invented.
Indeed, Watt, upon one occasion, congratulated himself that
one of his steam-cylinders only lacked <i>three-eighths</i> of an
inch of being truly cylindrical.</p>

<p>The history of the steam-engine is from this time a history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the work of the firm of Boulton &amp; Watt. Newcomen
engines continued to be built for years after Watt
went to Soho, and by many builders. A host of inventors
still worked on the most attractive of all mechanical combinations,
seeking to effect further improvements. Some
inventions were made by contemporaries of Watt, as will
be seen hereafter, which were important as being the germs
of later growths; but these were nearly all too far in advance
of the time, and nearly every successful and important
invention which marked the history of steam-power for
many years originated in the fertile brain of James Watt.</p>

<p>The defects of the Newcomen engine were so serious,
that it was no sooner known that Boulton of Soho had
become interested in a new machine for raising water by
steam-power, than inquiries came to him from all sides,
from mine-owners who were on the point of being drowned
out, and from proprietors whose profits were absorbed by
the expense of pumping, and who were glad to pay the &pound;5
per horse-power per year finally settled upon as royalty.
The London municipal water-works authorities were also
ready to negotiate for pumping-engines for raising water to
supply the metropolis. The firm was therefore at once
driven to make preparations for a large business.</p>

<p>The first and most important matter, however, was to
secure an extension of the patent, which was soon to expire.
If not renewed, the 15 years of study and toil, of poverty
and anxiety, through which Watt had toiled, would
prove profitless to the inventor, and the fruits of his genius
would have become the unearned property of others. Watt
saw, at one time, little hope of securing the necessary act of
Parliament, and was greatly tempted to accept a position
tendered him by the Russian Government, upon the solicitation
of his old friend, Dr. Robison, then a Professor of
Mathematics at the Naval School at Cronstadt. The salary
was &pound;1,000&mdash;a princely income for a man in Watt&#8217;s circumstances,
and a peculiar temptation to the needy mechanic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Watt, however, went to London, and, with the help of
his own and of Boulton&#8217;s influential friends, succeeded in
getting his bill through. His patent was extended 24
years, and Boulton &amp; Watt set about the work of introducing
their engines with the industry and enterprise which
characterized their every act.</p>

<p>In the new firm, Boulton took charge of the general
business, and Watt superintended the design, construction,
and erection of their engines. Boulton&#8217;s business capacity,
with Watt&#8217;s wonderful mechanical ability&mdash;Boulton&#8217;s physical
health, and his vigor and courage, offsetting Watt&#8217;s
feeble health and depression of spirits&mdash;and, more than all,
Boulton&#8217;s pecuniary resources, both in his own purse and in
those of his friends, enabled the firm to conquer all difficulties,
whether in finance, in litigation, or in engineering.</p>

<p>It was only after the successful erection and operation
of several engines that Boulton and Watt became legally
partners. The understood terms were explicitly stated by
Watt to include an assignment to Boulton of two-thirds
the patent-right; Boulton paying all expenses, advancing
stock in trade at an appraised valuation, on which it was to
draw interest; Watt making all drawings and designs, and
drawing one-third net profits.</p>

<p>As soon as Watt was relieved of the uncertainties regarding
his business connections, he married a second wife,
who, as Arago says, by &#8220;her various talent, soundness of
judgment, and strength of character,&#8221; made a worthy companion
to the large-hearted and large-brained engineer.
Thenceforward his cares were only such as every business-man
expects to be compelled to sustain, and the next ten
years were the most prolific in inventions of any period in
Watt&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>From 1775 to 1785 the partners acquired five patents,
covering a large number of valuable improvements upon
the steam-engine, and several independent inventions. The
first of these patents covered the now familiar and universally-used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
copying-press for letters, and a machine for drying
cloth by passing it between copper rollers filled with
steam of sufficiently high temperature to rapidly evaporate
the moisture. This patent was issued February 14, 1780.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig27" id="Fig27"></a>
<img src="images/illo131.png" alt="Watt's Engine" width="400" height="488" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Watt&#8217;s Engine, 1781.</p></div>

<p>In the following year, October 25, 1781, Watt patented
five devices by which he obtained the rotary motion of the
engine-shaft without the use of a crank. One of these was
the arrangement shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>, and known as the &#8220;sun-and-planet&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wheels. The crank-shaft carries a gear-wheel,
which is engaged by another securely fixed upon the end of
the connecting-rod. As the latter is compelled to revolve
about the axis of the shaft by a tie which confines the connecting-rod
end at a fixed distance from the shaft, the
shaft-gear is compelled to revolve, and the shaft with it.
Any desired velocity-ratio was secured by giving the two
gears the necessary relative diameters. A fly-wheel was
used to regulate the motion of the shaft.<a name="FNanchor_39_39"
id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Boulton &amp; Watt
used the sun-and-planet device on many engines, but finally
adopted the crank, when the expiration of the patent held
by Matthew Wasborough, and which had earlier date than
Watt&#8217;s patent of 1781, permitted them. Watt had proposed
the use of a crank, it is said, as early as 1771, but Wasborough
anticipated him in securing the patent. Watt had made
a model of an engine with a crank and fly-wheel, and he has
stated that one of his workmen, who had seen the model,
described it to Wasborough, thus enabling the latter to deprive
Watt of his own property. The proceeding excited
great indignation on the part of Watt; but no legal action
was taken by Boulton &amp; Watt, as the overthrow of the
patent was thought likely to do them injury by permitting
its use by more active competitors and more ingenious men.</p>

<p>The next patent issued to Watt was an exceedingly important
one, and of especial interest in a history of the
development of the economical application of steam. This
patent included:</p>

<p>1. The expansion of steam, and six methods of applying
the principle and of equalizing the expansive power.</p>

<p>2. The double-acting steam-engine, in which the steam
acts on each side of the piston alternately, the opposite side
being in communication with the condenser.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>3. The double or coupled steam-engine&mdash;two engines
capable of working together, or independently, as may be
desired.</p>

<p>4. The use of a rack on the piston-rod, working into a
sector on the end of the beam, thus securing a perfect rectilinear
motion of the rod.</p>

<p>5. A rotary engine, or &#8220;steam-wheel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The efficiency to be secured by the expansion of steam
had long been known to Watt, and he had conceived the
idea of economizing some of that power, the waste of which
was so plainly indicated by the violent rushing of the exhaust-steam
into the condenser, as early as 1769. This was
described in a letter to Dr. Small, of Birmingham, in May of
that year. When experimenting at Kinneil, he had tried
to determine the real value of the principle by trial on his
small engine.</p>

<p>Boulton had also recognized the importance of this improved
method of working steam, and their earlier Soho
engines were, as Watt said, made with cylinders &#8220;double
the size wanted, and cut off the steam at half-stroke.&#8221; But,
though &#8220;this was a great saving of steam, so long as the
valves remained as at first,&#8221; the builders were so constantly
annoyed by alterations of the valves by proprietors and
their engineers, that they finally gave up that method of
working, hoping ultimately to be able to resume it when
workmen of greater intelligence and reliability could be
found. The patent was issued July 17, 1782.</p>

<p>Watt specified a cut-off at one-quarter stroke as usually
best.</p>

<p>Watt&#8217;s explanation of the method of economizing by
expansive working, as given to Dr. Small,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is worthy of reproduction.
He says: &#8220;I mentioned to you a method of
still doubling the effect of steam, and that tolerably easy,
by using the power of steam rushing into a vacuum, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
present lost. This would do a little more than double the
effect, but it would too much enlarge the vessels to use it
all. It is peculiarly applicable to wheel-engines, and may
supply the want of a condenser where force of steam is only
used; for, open one of the steam-valves and admit steam,
until one-fourth of the distance between it and the next
valve is filled with steam, shut the valve, and the steam
will continue to expand and to pass round the wheel with a
diminishing power, ending in one-fourth its first exertion.
The sum of this series you will find greater than one-half,
though only one-fourth steam was used. The power will
indeed be unequal, but this can be remedied by a fly, or in
several other ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Watt suggests, above, the now
well-known non-condensing engine. He had already, as has
been seen, described it in his patent of 1769, as also the
rotary engine.</p>

<p>Watt illustrates and explains his idea very neatly, by
a sketch similar to that here given (<a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>).</p>

<p>Steam, entering the cylinder at <i>a</i>, is admitted until one-fourth
the stroke has been made, when the steam-valve is
closed, and the remainder of the stroke is performed without
further addition of steam. The variation of steam-pressure
is approximately inversely proportional to the variation
of its volume. Thus, at half-stroke, the pressure becomes
one-half that at which the steam was supplied to the
cylinder. At the end of the stroke it has fallen to one-fourth
the initial pressure. The pressure is always nearly
equal to the product of the initial pressure and volume
divided by the volume at the given instant. In symbols,</p>

<p>It is true that the condensation of steam doing work
changes this law in a marked manner; but the condensation
and re&euml;vaporation of steam, due to the transfer of heat to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and from the metal of the cylinder, tends to compensate
the first variation by a reverse change of pressure with
change of volume.</p>

<p>The sketch shows this progressive variation of pressure
as expansion proceeds. It is seen that the work done per
unit of volume of steam as taken from the boiler is much
greater than when working without expansion. The product
of the mean pressure by the volume of the cylinder is
less, but the quotient obtained by dividing this quantity by
the volume or weight of steam taken from the boiler, is
much greater with than without expansion. For the case
assumed and illustrated, the work done during expansion is
one and two-fifths times that done previous to cutting off
the steam, and the work done per pound of steam is 2.4
times that done without expansion.</p>

<p>Were there no losses to be met with and to be exaggerated
by the use of steam expansively, the gain would become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
very great with moderate expansion, amounting to
twice the work done when &#8220;following&#8221; full stroke, when
the steam is cut off at one-seventh. The estimated gain is,
however, never realized. Losses by friction, by conduction
and radiation of heat, and by condensation and re&euml;vaporation
in the cylinder&mdash;of which losses the latter are most
serious&mdash;after passing a point which is variable, and which
is determined by the special conditions in each case, augment
with greater rapidity than the gain by expansion.</p>

<p>In actual practice, it is rarely found, except where special
precautions are taken to reduce these losses, that economy
follows expansion to a greater number of volumes than
about one-half the square root of the steam-pressure; i. e.,
about twice for 15 or 20 pounds pressure, three times for
about 30 pounds, and four and five times for 60 or 65 and
for 100 to 125 pounds respectively. Watt very soon learned
this general principle; but neither he, nor even many modern
engineers, seem to have learned that too great expansion
often gives greatly-reduced economy.</p>

<p>The inequality of pressure due to expansion, to which
he refers, was a source of much perplexity to Watt, as he
was for a long time convinced that he must find some
method of &#8220;equalizing&#8221; the consequent irregular effort of
the steam upon the piston. The several methods of &#8220;equalizing
the expansive power&#8221; which are referred to in the
patent were attempts to secure this result. By one method,
he shifted the centre as the beam vibrated, thus changing
the lengths of the arms of that great lever, to compensate
the change of moment consequent upon the change of pressure.
He finally concluded that a fly-wheel, as first proposed
by Fitzgerald, who advised its use on Papin&#8217;s engine, would
be the best device on engines driving a crank, and trusted
to the inertia of a balance-weight in his pumping-engines,
or to the weight of the pump-rods, and permitted the piston
to take its own speed so far as it was not thus controlled.</p>

<p>The double-acting engine was a modification of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> single-acting
engine, and was very soon determined upon after
the successful working of the latter had become assured.</p>

<p>Watt had covered in the top of his single-acting engine,
to prevent cooling the interior of the cylinder by contact
with the comparatively cold atmosphere. When this had
been done, there was but a single step required to convert
the machine into the double-acting engine. This alteration,
by which the steam was permitted to act upon the upper
and the lower sides of the piston alternately, had been proposed
by Watt as early as 1767, and a drawing of the engine
was laid before a committee of the House of Commons
in 1774-&#8217;75. By this simple change Watt doubled the
power of his engine. Although invented much earlier, the
plan was not patented until he was, as he states, driven to
take out the patent by the &#8220;plagiarists and pirates&#8221; who
were always ready to profit by his ingenuity. This form
of engine is now almost universally used. The single-acting
pumping-engine remains in use in Cornwall, and in a few
other localities, and now and then an engine is built for
other purposes, in which steam acts only on one side of the
piston; but these are rare exceptions to the general rule.</p>

<p>The subject of his next invention was not less interesting.
The double-cylinder or &#8220;compound&#8221; engine has now,
after the lapse of nearly a century, become an important
and usual type of engine. It is impossible to determine
precisely to whom to award the credit of its first conception.
Dr. Falk, in 1779, had proposed a double-acting engine,
in which there were two single-acting cylinders, acting
in opposite directions and alternately on opposite sides of a
wheel, with which a rack on the piston-rod of each geared.</p>

<p>Watt claimed that Hornblower, the patentee of the
&#8220;compound engine,&#8221; was an infringer upon his patents; and,
holding the patent on the separate condenser, he was able
to prevent the engine of his competitor taking such form as
to be successfully introduced. The Hornblower engine was
soon given up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Watt stated that this form of engine had been invented
by him as early as 1767, and that he had explained its peculiarities
to Smeaton and others several years before Hornblower
attempted to use it. He wrote to Boulton: &#8220;It is
no less than our double-cylinder engine, worked upon our
principle of expansion.&#8221; He never made use of the plan,
however; and the principal object sought, apparently, in
patenting this, as well as many other devices, was to secure
himself against competition.</p>

<p>The rack and sector patented at this time was soon superseded
by the parallel-motion; and the last claim, the
&#8220;steam-wheel&#8221; or rotary engine, although one was built of
considerable size, was not introduced.</p>

<p>After the patent of 1782 had been secured, Watt turned
his attention, when not too hard-pressed by business, to
other schemes, and to experimenting with still other modifications
and applications of his engine. He had, as early
as 1777, proposed to make a steam-hammer for Wilkinson&#8217;s
forge; but he was too closely engaged with more important
matters to take hold of the project with much earnestness
until late in the year 1782, when, after some preliminary
trials, he reported, December 13th: &#8220;We have tried our
little tilting-forge hammer at Soho with success. The following
are some of the particulars: Cylinder, 15 inches in
diameter; 4 feet stroke; strokes per minute, 20. The
hammer-head, 120 pounds weight, rises 8 inches, and strikes
240 blows per minute. The machine goes quite regularly,
and can be managed as easily as a water-mill. It requires
a very small quantity of steam&mdash;not above half the contents
of the cylinder per stroke. The power employed is not
more than one-fourth of what would be required to raise
the quantity of water which would enable a water-wheel to
work the same hammer with the same velocity.&#8221;</p>

<p>He immediately set about making a much heavier
hammer, and on April 26, 1783, he wrote that he had
done &#8220;a thing never done before&#8221;&mdash;making his hammer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
strike 300 blows a minute. This hammer weighed 7<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> hundredweight,
and had a drop of 2 feet. The steam-cylinder
had a diameter of 42 inches and 6 feet stroke of piston, and
was calculated to have sufficient power to drive four hammers
weighing 7 hundredweight each. The engine made
20 strokes per minute, the hammer giving 90 blows in the
same time.</p>

<p>This new application of steam-power proving successful,
Watt next began to develop a series of minor inventions,
which were finally secured by his patent of April 27, 1784,
together with the steam tilt-hammer, and a steam-carriage,
or &#8220;locomotive engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The contrivance previously used for guiding the head of
the piston-rod&mdash;the sectors and chains, or rack&mdash;had never
given satisfaction. The rudeness of design of the contrivance
was only equalled by its insecurity. Watt therefore
contrived a number of methods of accomplishing the purpose,
the most beautiful and widely-known of which is the
&#8220;parallel-motion,&#8221; although it has now been generally superseded
by one of the other devices patented at the same
time&mdash;the cross-head and guides. As originally proposed, a
rod was attached to the head of the piston-rod, standing
vertically when the latter was at quarter-stroke. The upper
end of this rod was pivoted to the end of the beam, and the
lower end to the extremity of a horizontal rod having a
length equal to one-half the length of the beam. The other
end of the horizontal rod was coupled to the frame of the
engine. As the piston rose and fell, the upper and lower
ends of the vertical rod were swayed in opposite directions,
and to an equal extent, by the beam and the lower horizontal
rod, the middle point at which the piston-rod was attached
preserving its position in the vertical line. This
form was objectionable, as the whole effort of the engine
was transmitted through the parallel-motion rods. Another
form is shown in the sketch given of the double-acting engine
in <a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>, which was free from this defect. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
head of the piston-rod, <i>g</i>, was guided by rods connecting it
with the frame at <i>c</i>, and forming a &#8220;parallelogram,&#8221; <i>g d e b</i>,
with the beam. Many varieties of &#8220;parallel-motion&#8221; have
been devised since Watt&#8217;s invention was attached to his
engines at Soho. They usually are more or less imperfect,
guiding the piston-rod in a line only approximately straight.</p>

<p>The cross-head and guides are now generally used, very
much as described by Watt in this patent as his &#8220;second
principle.&#8221; This device will be seen in the engravings
given hereafter of more modern engines. The head of the
piston-rod is fitted into a transverse bar, or cross-head,
which carries properly-shaped pieces at its extremities, to
which are bolted &#8220;gibs,&#8221; so made as to fit upon guides secured
to the engine-frame. These guides are adjusted to
precise parallelism with the centre line of the cylinder.
The cross-head, sliding in or on these guides, moves in a
perfectly straight line, and, compelling the piston-rod to
move with it, the latter is even more perfectly guided than
by a parallel-motion. This arrangement, where properly
proportioned, is not necessarily subject to great friction,
and is much more easily adjusted and kept in line than the
parallel-motion when wear occurs or maladjustment takes
place.</p>

<p>By the same patent, Watt secured the now common
&#8220;puppet-valve&#8221; with beveled seat, and the application of
the steam-engine to driving rolling-mills and hammers for
forges, and to &#8220;wheel-carriages for removing persons or
goods, or other matters, from place to place.&#8221; For the latter
purpose he proposes to use boilers &#8220;of wood, or of thin
metal, strongly secured by hoops or otherwise,&#8221; and containing
&#8220;internal fire-boxes.&#8221; He proposed to use a condenser
cooled by currents of air.</p>

<p>It would require too much space to follow Watt in all
his schemes for the improvement and for the application of
the steam-engine. A few of the more important and more
ingenious only can be described. Many of the contracts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Boulton &amp; Watt gave them, as compensation for their engines,
a fraction&mdash;usually one-third&mdash;of the value of the
fuel saved by the use of the Watt engine in place of the
engine of Newcomen, the amount due being paid annually
or semiannually, with an option of redemption on the part
of the purchaser at ten years&#8217; purchase. This form of
agreement compelled a careful determination, often, of the
work done and fuel consumed by both the engine taken out
and that put in its place. It was impossible to rely upon
any determination by personal observation of the number
of strokes made by the engine. Watt therefore made a
&#8220;counter,&#8221; like that now familiar to every one as used on
gas-meters. It consists of a train of wheels moving pointers
on several dials, the first dial showing tens, the second
hundreds, the third thousands, etc., strokes or revolutions.
Motion was communicated to the train by means of a pendulum,
the whole being mounted on the beam of the engine,
where every vibration produced a swing of the pendulum.
Eight dials were sometimes used, the counter being set and
locked, and only opened once a year, when the time arrived
for determining the work done during the preceding twelve-month.</p>

<p>The application of his engine to purposes for which
careful adjustment of speed was requisite, or where the load
was subject to considerable variation, led to the use of a
controlling-valve in the steam-pipe, called the &#8220;throttle-valve,&#8221;
which was adjustable by hand, and permitted the
supply of steam to the engine to be adjusted at any instant
and altered to any desired extent. It is now given many
forms, but it still is most usually made just as originally
designed by Watt. It consists of a circular disk, which
just closes up the steam-pipe when set directly across it, or
of an elliptical disk, which closes the pipe when standing
at an angle of somewhat less than 90&deg; with the line of
the pipe. This disk is carried on a spindle extending
through the pipe at one side, and carrying on its outer end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
an arm by means of which it may be turned into any position.
When placed with its face in line with the pipe, it
offers very little resistance to the flow of steam to the engine.
When set in the other position, it shuts off steam
entirely and stops the engine. It is placed in such position
at any time, that the speed of the engine is just that required
at the time. In the engraving of the double-acting
engine with fly-wheel (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>), it is shown at <i>T</i>, as controlled
by the governor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig29" id="Fig29"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;The Governor.</p></div>

<p>The <a href="#Fig29">governor</a>, or &#8220;fly-ball governor,&#8221; as it is often
distinctively called, was another of Watt&#8217;s minor but very
essential inventions. Two heavy iron or brass balls, <i>B B&#8242;</i>,
were suspended from pins, <i>C C&#8242;</i>, in a little cross-piece carried
on the head of a vertical spindle, <i>A A&#8242;</i>, driven by the
engine. The speed of the engine varying, that of the spindle
changed correspondingly, and the faster the balls were swung
the farther they separated. When the engine&#8217;s speed decreased,
the period of revolution of the balls was increased,
and they fell back toward the spindle. Whenever the velocity
of the engine was uniform, the balls preserved their distance
from the spindle and remained at the same height, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
altitude being determined by the relation existing between
the force of gravity and centrifugal force in the temporary
position of equilibrium. The distance from the point of suspension
down to the level of the balls is always equal to 9.78
inches divided by the square of the number of revolutions
per second&mdash;i. e.,</p>

<p>The arms carrying the balls, or the balls themselves, are
pinned to rods, <i>M M&#8242;</i>, which are connected to a piece, <i>N N&#8242;</i>,
sliding loosely on the spindle. A score, <i>T</i>, cut in this piece
engages a lever, <i>V</i>, and, as the balls rise and fall, a rod, <i>W</i>,
is moved, closing and opening the throttle-valve, and thus
adjusting the supply of steam in such a way as to preserve
a nearly fixed speed of engine. The connection with the
throttle-valve and with the cut-off valve-gear is seen not
only in the engraving of the double-acting Watt engine, but
also in those of the Greene and the Corliss engines. This
contrivance had previously been used in regulating water-wheels
and windmills. Watt&#8217;s invention consisted in its
application to the regulation of the steam-engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig30" id="Fig30"></a>
<img src="images/illo144.png" alt="Steam and Water Gauge" width="350" height="300" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span><br />Mercury Steam Gauge. Glass Water Gauge.</p></div>

<p>Still another useful invention of Watt&#8217;s was his &#8220;mercury
steam-gauge&#8221;&mdash;a barometer in which the height of the
mercury was determined by the pressure of the steam instead
of that of the atmosphere. This simple instrument
consisted merely of a bent tube containing a portion of
mercury. One leg, <i>B D</i>, of this U-tube was connected with
the steam-pipe, or with the boiler by a small steam-pipe; the
other end, <i>C</i>, was open to the atmosphere. The pressure of
the steam on the mercury in <i>B D</i> caused it to rise in the
other &#8220;leg&#8221; to a height exactly proportioned to the pressure,
and causing very nearly two inches difference of level
to the pound, or one inch to the pound actual rise in the
outer leg. The rude sketch from Farey, here given (<a href="#Fig30">Fig.
30</a>), indicates sufficiently well the form of this gauge. It is
still considered by engineers the most reliable of all forms
of steam-gauge. Unfortunately, it is not conveniently applicable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
at high pressure. The scale, <i>A</i>, is marked with
numbers indicating the pressure, which numbers are indicated
by the head of a rod floating up with the mercury.</p>

<p>A similar gauge was used to determine the degree of
perfection of vacuum attained in the condenser, the mercury
falling in the outer leg as the vacuum became more
complete. A perfect vacuum would cause a depression of
level in that leg to 30 inches below the level of the mercury
in the leg connected with the condenser. In a more usual
form, it consisted of a simple glass tube having its lower
end immersed in a cistern of mercury, as in the ordinary
barometer, the top of the tube being connected with a pipe
leading to the condenser. With a perfect vacuum in the
condenser, the mercury would rise in the tube very nearly
30 inches. Ordinarily, the vacuum is not nearly perfect,
and, a back pressure remaining in the condenser of one or
two pounds per square inch, the atmospheric pressure remaining
unbalanced is only sufficient to raise the mercury
26 or 28 inches above the level of the liquid metal in the
cistern.</p>

<p>To determine the height of water in his boiler, Watt
added to the gauge-cocks already long in use the &#8220;glass
water-gauge,&#8221; which is still seen in nearly every well-arranged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
boiler. This was a glass tube, <i>a a&#8242;</i> (<a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>),
mounted on a standard attached to the front of the boiler,
and at such a height that its middle point was very little
below the proposed water-level. It was connected by
a small pipe, <i>r</i>, at the top to the steam-space, and another
little pipe, <i>r&#8242;</i>, led into the boiler from its lower end
below the water-line. As the water rose and fell within
the boiler, its level changed correspondingly in the glass.
This little instrument is especially liked, because the position
of the water is at all times shown to the eye of the
attendant. If carefully protected against sudden changes
of temperature, it answers perfectly well with even very
high pressures.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Boulton &amp; Watt&#8217;s Double-Acting Engine, 1784.</p></div>

<p>The engines built by Boulton &amp; Watt were finally fitted
with the crank and fly-wheel for application to the driving
of mills and machinery. The accompanying engraving
(<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>) shows the engine as thus made, combining all of
the essential improvements designed by its inventor.</p>

<p>In the engraving, <i>C</i> is the steam-cylinder, <i>P</i> the piston,
connected to the beam by the link, <i>g</i>, and guided by the
parallel-motion, <i>g d c</i>. At the opposite end of the beam a
connecting-rod, <i>O</i>, connects with the crank and fly-wheel
shaft. <i>R</i> is the rod of the air-pump, by means of which
the condenser is kept from being flooded by the water used
for condensation, which water-supply is regulated by an
&#8220;injection-handle,&#8221; <i>E</i>. A pump-rod, <i>N</i>, leads down from
the beam to the cold-water pump, by which water is raised
from the well or other source to supply the needed injection-water.
The air-pump rod also serves as a &#8220;plug-rod,&#8221; to
work the valves, the pins at <i>m</i> and <i>R</i> striking the lever, <i>m</i>,
at either end of the stroke. When the piston reaches the
top of the cylinder, the lever, <i>m</i>, is raised, opening the
steam-valve, <i>B</i>, at the top, and the exhaust-valve, <i>E</i>, at the
bottom, and at the same time closing the exhaust at the
top and the steam at the bottom. When the entrance of
steam at the top and the removal of steam-pressure below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the piston has driven the piston to the bottom, the pin, <i>R</i>,
strikes the lever, <i>m</i>, opening the steam and closing the
exhaust valve at the bottom, and similarly reversing the position
of the valves at the top. The position of the valves is
changed in this manner with every reversal of the motion
of the piston as the crank &#8220;turns over the centre.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earliest engines of the double-acting kind, and of
any considerable size, which were built to turn a shaft, were
those which were set up in the Albion Mills, near Blackfriars&#8217;
Bridge, London, in 1786, and destroyed when the
mills burned down in 1791. There were a pair of these
engines (shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>), of 50 horse-power each, and
geared to drive 20 pairs of stones, making fine flour and
meal. Previous to the erection of this mill the power
in all such establishments had been derived from windmills
and water-wheels. This mill was erected by Boulton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
&amp; Watt, and capitalists working with them, not only
to secure the profit anticipated from locating a flour-mill
in the city of London, but also with a view to exhibiting
the capacity of the new double-acting &#8220;rotating&#8221; engine.
The plan was proposed in 1783, and work was commenced
in 1784; but the mill was not set in operation until
the spring of 1786. The capacity of the mill was, in ordinary
work, 16,000 bushels of wheat ground into fine flour
per week. On one occasion, the mill turned out 3,000 bushels
in 24 hours. In the construction of the machinery of
the mill, many improvements upon the then standard practice
were introduced, including cast-iron gearing with carefully-formed
teeth and iron framing. It was here that John
Rennie commenced his work, after passing through his apprenticeship
in Scotland, sending his chief assistant, Ewart,
to superintend the erection of the milling machinery. The
mill was a success as a piece of engineering, but a serious
loss was incurred by the capitalists engaged in the enterprise,
as it was set on fire a few years afterward and entirely
destroyed. Boulton and Watt were the principal
losers, the former losing &pound;6,000, and the latter &pound;3,000.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Valve-Gear of the Albion Mills Engine.</p></div>

<p>The valve-gear of this engine, a view of which is given
in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>, was quite similar to that used on the Watt
pumping-engine. The accompanying illustration (<a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>)
represents this valve-motion as attached to the Albion Mills
engine.</p>

<p>The steam-pipe, <i>a b d d e</i>, leads the steam from the boiler
to the chambers, <i>b</i> and <i>e</i>. The exhaust-pipe, <i>g g</i>, leads
from <i>h</i> and <i>i</i> to the condenser. In the sketch, the upper
steam and the lower exhaust valves, <i>b</i> and <i>f</i>, are opened,
and the steam-valve, <i>e</i>, and exhaust-valve, <i>c</i>, are closed, the
piston being near the upper end of the cylinder and descending.
<i>l</i> represents the plug-frame, which carries tappets,
2 and 3, which engage the lever, <i>s</i>, at either end of its
throw, and turn the shaft, <i>u</i>, thus opening and closing <i>c</i> and
<i>e</i> simultaneously by means of the connecting-links, 13 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
14. A similar pair of tappets on the opposite side of the
plug-rod move the valves, <i>b</i> and <i>f</i>, by means of the rods, 10
and 11, the arm, <i>r</i>, when struck by those tappets, turning
the shaft, <i>t</i>, and thus moving the arms to which those rods
are attached. Counterbalance-weights, carried on the ends
of the arms, 4 and 15, retain the valves on their seats when
closed by the action of the tappets. When the piston
nearly reaches the lower end of the cylinder, the tappet, 1,
engages the arm, <i>r</i>, closing the steam-valve, <i>b</i>, and the next
instant shutting the exhaust-valve, <i>f</i>. At the same time, the
tappet, 3, by moving the arm, <i>s</i>, downward, opens the steam-valve,
<i>e</i>, and the exhaust-valve, <i>c</i>. Steam now no longer
issues from the steam-pipe into the space, <i>c</i>, and thence into
the engine-cylinder (not shown in the sketch); but it now
enters the engine through the valve, <i>e</i>, forcing the piston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
upwards. The exhaust is simultaneously made to occur at
the upper end, the rejected steam passing from the engine
into the space, <i>c</i>, and thence through <i>c</i> and the pipe, <i>g</i>, into
the condenser.</p>

<p>This kind of valve-gear was subsequently greatly improved
by Murdoch, Watt&#8217;s ingenious and efficient foreman,
but it is now entirely superseded on engines of this
class by the eccentric, and the various forms of valve-gear
driven by it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig33" id="Fig33"></a>
<img src="images/illo149.png" alt="Watt's Half-Trunk Engine" width="350" height="531" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Watt&#8217;s Half-Trunk Engine, 1784.</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;trunk-engine&#8221; was still another of the almost innumerable
inventions of Watt. A half-trunk engine is
described in his patent of 1784, as shown in the accompanying
sketch (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>), in which <i>A</i> is the cylinder, <i>B</i> the
piston, and <i>C</i> its rod, encased in the half-trunk, <i>D</i>. The
plug-rod, <i>G</i>, moves the single pair of valves by striking the
catches, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, as was usual with Watt&#8217;s earlier engines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Watt&#8217;s steam-hammer was patented at the same time.
It is seen in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>, in which <i>A</i> is the steam-cylinder and
<i>B</i> its rod, the engine being evidently of the form just described.
It works a beam, <i>C C</i>, which in turn, by the rod,
<i>M</i>, works the hammer-helve, <i>L J</i>, and the hammer, <i>L</i>. The
beam, <i>F G</i>, is a spring, and the block, <i>N</i>, the anvil.</p>

<p>Watt found it impossible to determine the duty of his
engines at all times by measurement of the work itself,
and endeavored to find a way of ascertaining the power
produced, by ascertaining the pressure of steam within
the cylinder. This pressure was so variable, and subject
to such rapid as well as extreme fluctuations, that
he found it impossible to make use of the steam-gauge
constructed for use on the boiler. He was thus driven to
invent a special instrument for this work, which he called
the &#8220;steam-engine indicator.&#8221; This consisted of a little
steam-cylinder containing a nicely-fitting piston, which
moved without noticeable friction through a range which
was limited by the compression of a helical spring, by means
of which the piston was secured to the top of its cylinder.
The distance through which the piston rose was proportional
to the pressure exerted upon it, and a pointer attached
to its rod traversed a scale upon which the pressure
per square inch could be read. The lower end of the instrument
being connected with the steam-cylinder of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
engine by a small pipe fitted with a cock, the opening of
the latter permitted steam from the engine-cylinder to fill
the indicator-cylinder, and the pressure of steam was always
the same in both cylinders. The indicator-pointer therefore
traversed the pressure-scale, always exhibiting the
pressure existing at the instant in the cylinder of the engine.
When the engine was at rest and steam off, the indicator-piston
stood at the same level as when detached from the
engine, and the pointer stood at 0 on the scale. When
steam entered, the piston rose and fell with the fluctuations
of pressure; and when the exhaust-valve opened, discharging
the steam and producing a vacuum in the steam-cylinder,
the pointer of the indicator dropped below 0, showing
the degree of exhaustion. Mr. Southern, one of Watt&#8217;s
assistants, fitted the instrument with a sliding board, moved
horizontally backward and forward by a cord or link-work
connecting directly or indirectly with the engine-beam, and
thus giving it a motion coincident with that of the piston.
This board carried a piece of paper, upon which a pencil
attached to the indicator piston-rod drew a curve. The
vertical height of any point on this curve above the base-line
measured the pressure in the cylinder at the moment
when it was made, and the horizontal distance of the point
from either end of the diagram determined the position, at
the same moment, of the engine-piston. The curve thus
inscribed, called the &#8220;indicator card,&#8221; or indicator diagram,
exhibiting every minute change in the pressure of steam in
the engine, not only enabled the mean pressure and the
power of the engine to be determined by its measurement,
but, to the eye of the expert engineer, it was a perfectly
legible statement of the position of the valves of the engine,
and revealed almost every defect in the action of the engine
which could not readily be detected by external examination.
It has justly been called the &#8220;engineers&#8217; stethoscope,&#8221;
opening the otherwise inaccessible parts of the steam-engine
to the inspection of the engineer even more satisfactorily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
than the stethoscope of the physician gives him a knowledge
of the condition and working of organs contained
within the human body. This indispensable and now familiar
engineers&#8217; instrument has since been modified and
greatly improved in detail.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;The Watt Hammer, 1784.</p></div>

<p>The Watt engine had, by the construction of the improvements
described in the patents of 1782-&#8217;85, been given
its distinctive form, and the great inventor subsequently
did little more than improve it by altering the forms and
proportions of its details. As thus practically completed,
it embodied nearly all the essential features of the modern
engine; and, as we have seen, the marked features of our
latest practice&mdash;the use of the double cylinder for expansion,
the cut-off valve-gear, and surface-condensation&mdash;had
all been proposed, and to a limited extent introduced. The
growth of the steam-engine has here ceased to be rapid, and
the changes which followed the completion of the work of
James Watt have been minor improvements, and rarely, if
ever, real developments.</p>

<p>Watt&#8217;s mind lost none of its activity, however, for many
years. He devised and patented a &#8220;smoke-consuming furnace,&#8221;
in which he led the gases produced on the introduction
of fresh fuel over the already incandescent coal, and
thus burned them completely. He used two fires, which
were coaled alternately. Even when busiest, also, he found
time to pursue more purely scientific studies. With Boulton,
he induced a number of well-known scientific men living
near Birmingham to join in the formation of a &#8220;Lunar
Society,&#8221; to meet monthly at the houses of its members, &#8220;at
the full of the moon.&#8221; The time was thus fixed in order
that those members who came from a distance should be
able to drive home, after the meetings, by moonlight.
Many such societies were then in existence in England; but
that at Birmingham was one of the largest and most distinguished
of them all. Boulton, Watt, Drs. Small, Darwin,
and Priestley, were the leaders, and among their occasional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
visitors were Herschel, Smeaton, and Banks. Watt
called these meetings &#8220;Philosophers&#8217; meetings.&#8221; It was
during the period of most active discussion at the &#8220;philosophers&#8217;
meetings&#8221; that Cavendish and Priestley were experimenting
with mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen, to determine
the nature of their combustion. Watt took much
interest in the subject, and, when informed by Priestley
that he and Cavendish had both noticed a deposit of moisture
invariably succeeding the explosion of the mixed gases,
when contained in a cold vessel, and that the weight of this
water was approximately equal to the weight of the mixed
gases, he at once came to the conclusion that the union of
hydrogen with oxygen produced water, the latter being a
chemical compound, of which the former were constituents.
He communicated this reasoning, and the conclusions to
which it had led him, to Boulton, in a letter written in December,
1782, and addressed a letter some time afterward
to Priestley, which was to have been read before the Royal
Society in April, 1783. The letter was not read, however,
until a year later, and, three months after, a paper by Cavendish,
making the same announcement, had been laid before
the Society. Watt stated that both Cavendish and Lavoisier,
to whom also the discovery is ascribed, received the
idea from him.</p>

<p>The action of chlorine in bleaching organic coloring-matters,
by (as since shown) decomposing them and combining
with their hydrogen, was made known to Watt by
M. Berthollet, the distinguished French chemist, and the
former immediately introduced its use into Great Britain,
by inducing his father-in-law, Mr. Macgregor, to make a
trial of it.</p>

<p>The copartnership of Boulton &amp; Watt terminated by
limitation, and with the expiration of the patents under
which they had been working, in the first year of the present
century; and both partners, now old and feeble, withdrew
from active business, leaving their sons to renew the agreement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and to carry on the business under the same firm-style.</p>

<p>Boulton, however, still interested himself in some
branches of manufacture, especially in his mint, where he
had coined many years and for several nations.</p>

<p>Watt retired, a little later, to Heathfield, where he
passed the remainder of his life in peaceful enjoyment of
the society of his friends, in studies of all current matters
of interest in science, as well as in engineering. One by
one his old friends died&mdash;Black in 1799, Priestley, an exile
to America, in 1803, and Robison a little later. Boulton
died, at the age of eighty-one, August 17, 1809, and even
the loss of this nearest and dearest of his friends outside the
family was a less severe blow than that of his son Gregory,
who died in 1804.</p>

<p>Yet the great engineer and inventor was not depressed
by the loneliness which was gradually coming upon him.
He wrote: &#8220;I know that all men must die, and I submit
to the decrees of Nature, I hope, with due reverence to
the Disposer of events;&#8221; and neglected no opportunity to
secure amusement or instruction, and kept body and mind
constantly occupied. He still attended the weekly meetings
of the club, meeting Rennie and Telford, and other
distinguished men of his own and the succeeding generation.
He lost nothing of his fondness for invention, and
spent many months in devising a machine for copying
statuary, which he had not perfected to his own satisfaction
at the time of his death, ten years later. This machine
was a kind of pentagraph, which could be worked
in any plane, and in which the marking-pencil gave place
to a cutting-tool. The tracing-point followed the surface
of the pattern, while the cutting-point, following its motion
precisely, formed a fac-simile in the material operated
upon.</p>

<p>In the year 1800 he invented the water-main which was
laid down by the Glasgow Water-Works Company across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the Clyde. The joints were spherical and articulated, like
those of the lobster&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>His workshop, of which a <a href="#Fig28">sketch</a> is hereafter given, as
drawn by the artist Skelton, was in the garret of his house,
and was well supplied with tools and all kinds of laboratory
material. His lathe and his copying-machine were placed
before the window, and his writing-desk in the corner.
Here he spent the greater part of his leisure time, often
even taking his meals in the little shop, rather than go to
the table for them. Even when very old, he occasionally
made a journey to London or Glasgow, calling on his old
friends and studying the latest engineering devices and inspecting
public works, and was everywhere welcomed by
young and old as the greatest living engineer, or as the kind
and wise friend of earlier days.</p>

<p>He died August 19, 1819, in the eighty-third year of his
age, and was buried in Handsworth Church. The sculptor
Chantrey was employed to place a fitting monument above
his grave, and the nation erected a statue of the great man
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>This sketch of the greatest of all the inventors of the
steam-engine has been given no greater length than its subject
justifies. Whether we consider Watt as the inventor
of the standard steam-engine of the nineteenth century, as
the scientific investigator of the physical principles upon
which the invention is based, or as the builder and introducer
of the most powerful known instrument by which the
&#8220;great sources of power in Nature are converted, adapted,
and applied for the use and convenience of man,&#8221; he is fully
entitled to pre&euml;minence. His character as a man was no
less admirable than as an engineer.</p>

<p>Smiles, Watt&#8217;s most conscientious and indefatigable
biographer, writes:<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Some months since, we visited the little garret at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Heathfield in which Watt pursued the investigations
of his later years. The room had been carefully locked
up since his death, and had only once been swept out.
Everything lay very much as he left it. The piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
iron which he was last employed in turning, lay on the
lathe. The ashes of the last fire were in the grate; the last
bit of coal was in the scuttle. The Dutch oven was in its
place over the stove, and the frying-pan in which he cooked
his meals was hanging on its accustomed nail. Many objects
lay about or in the drawers, indicating the pursuits
which had been interrupted by death&mdash;busts, medallions,
and figures, waiting to be copied by the copying-machine&mdash;many
medallion-moulds, a store of plaster-of-Paris, and a
box of plaster casts from London, the contents of which do
not seem to have been disturbed. Here are Watt&#8217;s ladles
for melting lead, his foot-rule, his glue-pot, his hammer.
Reflecting mirrors, an extemporized camera with the lenses
mounted on pasteboard, and many camera-glasses laid about,
indicate interrupted experiments in optics. There are quadrant-glasses,
compasses, scales, weights, and sundry boxes
of mathematical instruments, once doubtless highly prized.
In one place a model of the governor, in another of the
parallel-motion, and in a little box, fitted with wooden cylinders
mounted with paper and covered with figures, is what
we suppose to be a model of his calculating-machine. On
the shelves are minerals and chemicals in pots and jars, on
which the dust of nearly half a century has settled. The
moist substances have long since dried up; the putty has
been turned to stone, and the paste to dust. On one shelf
we come upon a dish in which lies a withered bunch of
grapes. On the floor, in a corner, near to where Watt sat
and worked, is a hair-trunk&mdash;a touching memorial of a long-past
love and a long-dead sorrow. It contains all poor
Gregory&#8217;s school-books, his first attempts at writing, his
boy&#8217;s drawings of battles, his first school-exercises down to
his college-themes, his delectuses, his grammars, his dictionaries,
and his class-books&mdash;brought into this retired room,
where the father&#8217;s eye could rest upon them. Near at hand
is the sculpture-machine, on which he continued working to
the last. Its wooden frame is worm-eaten, and dropping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
into dust, like the hands that made it. But though the
great workman is gone to rest, with all his griefs and cares,
and his handiwork is fast crumbling to decay, the spirit of
his work, the thought which he put into his inventions, still
survives, and will probably continue to influence the destinies
of his race for all time to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitor to Westminster Abbey will find neither monarch,
nor warrior, nor statesman, nor poet, honored with a
nobler epitaph than that which is inscribed on the pedestal
of Chantrey&#8217;s monument to Watt:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;The Contemporaries of James Watt.</span></h4>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>In the chronology of the steam-engine, the contemporaries
of Watt have been so completely overshadowed by the
greater and more successful inventor, as to have been almost
forgotten by the biographer and by the student of history.
Yet, among the engineers and engine-builders, as well as
among the inventors of his day, Watt found many enterprising
rivals and keen competitors. Some of these men, had
they not been so completely fettered by Watt&#8217;s patents,
would have probably done work which would have entitled
them to far higher honor than has been accorded them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Murdoch</span> was one of the men to whom Watt,
no less than the world, was greatly indebted. For many years
he was the assistant, friend, and coadjutor of Watt; and it
is to his ingenuity that we are to give credit for not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
many independent inventions, but also for the suggestions
and improvements which were often indispensable to the
formation and perfection of some of Watt&#8217;s own inventions.</p>

<p>Murdoch was employed by Boulton &amp; Watt in 1776,
and was made superintendent of construction in the engine
department, and given general charge of the erection of engines.
He was sent into Cornwall, and spent in that district
much of the time during which he served the firm, erecting
pumping-engines, the construction of which for so
many years constituted a large part of the business of the
Soho establishment. He was looked upon by both Boulton
and Watt as a sincere friend, as well as a loyal adherent,
and from 1810 to 1830 was given a partner&#8217;s share of the
income of the firm, and a salary of &pound;1,000. He retired from
business at the last of the two dates named, and, dying in
1839, was buried near the two partners in Handsworth
Church.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig36" id="Fig36"></a>
<img src="images/illo161.png" alt="Murdoch's Oscillating Engine" width="270" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Murdoch&#8217;s Oscillating Engine, 1785.</p></div>

<p>Murdoch made a model, in 1784, of the locomotive patented
by Watt in that year. He devised the arrangement
of &#8220;sun-and-planet wheels,&#8221; adopted for a time in all of
Watt&#8217;s &#8220;rotative&#8221; engines, and invented the oscillating
steam-engine (<a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>) in 1785, using the &#8220;D-slide valves,&#8221;
<i>G</i>, moved by the gear, <i>E</i>, which was driven by an eccentric
on the shaft, without regard to the oscillation of the cylinder,
<i>A</i>. He was the inventor of a rotary engine and of
many minor machines for special purposes, and of many
machine-tools used at Soho in building engines and machines.
He seems, like Watt, to have had special fondness
for the worm-gear, and introduced it wherever it could
properly take the place of ordinary gearing. Some of the
machines designed by Watt and Murdoch, who always
worked well together, were found still in use and in good
working condition by the author when visiting the works at
Soho in 1873. The old mint in which, from 1797 to 1805,
Boulton had coined 4,000 tons of copper, had then been
pulled down, and a new mint had been erected in 1860.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Many old machines still remained about the establishment
as souvenirs of the three great mechanics.</p>

<p>Outside of Soho, Murdoch also found ample employment
for his inventive talent. In 1792, while at Redruth, his
residence before finally returning to Soho, he was led to
speculate upon the possibility of utilizing the illuminating
qualities of coal-gas, and, convinced of its practicability, he
laid the subject before the Royal Society in 1808, and was
awarded the Rumford gold medal. He had, ten years earlier,
lighted a part of the Soho works with coal-gas, and in
1803 Watt authorized him to extend his pipes throughout
all the buildings. Several manufacturers promptly introduced
the new light, and its use extended very rapidly.</p>

<p>Still another of Murdoch&#8217;s favorite schemes was the
transmission of power by the use of compressed air. He
drove the pattern-shop engine at Soho by means of air from
the blowing-engine in the foundery, and erected a pneumatic
lift to elevate castings from the foundery-floor to the canal-bank.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
He made a steam-gun, introduced the heating of
buildings by the circulation of hot water, and invented the
method of transmitting packages through tubes by the impulse
of compressed air, as now practised by the &#8220;pneumatic
dispatch&#8221; companies. He died at the age of eighty-five

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>&mdash;Hornblower&#8217;s Compound Engine, 1781.</p></div>

<p>Among the most active and formidable of Watt&#8217;s business
rivals was <span class="smcap">Jonathan Hornblower</span>, the patentee of
the &#8220;compound&#8221; or double-cylinder engine. A sketch of
this engine, as patented by Hornblower in 1781, is here
given (<a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>). It was first described by the inventor in
the &#8220;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica.&#8221; It consists, as is seen by
reference to the engraving, of two steam-cylinders, <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>&mdash;<i>A</i> being the low and <i>B</i> the high pressure cylinder&mdash;the
steam leaving the latter being exhausted into the former,
and, after doing its work there, passing into the condenser,
as already described. The piston-rods, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, are both
connected to the same part of the beam by chains, as in the
other early engines. These rods pass through stuffing-boxes
in the cylinder-heads, which are fitted up like those seen on
the Watt engine. Steam is led to the engine through the
pipe, <i>G Y</i>, and cocks, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, are adjustable, as required,
to lead steam into and from the cylinders, and are
moved by the plug-rod, <i>W</i>, which actuates handles not
shown. <i>K</i> is the exhaust-pipe leading to the condenser. <i>V</i>
is the engine feed-pump rod, and <i>X</i> the great rod carrying
the pump-buckets at the bottom of the shaft.</p>

<p>The cocks <i>c</i> and <i>a</i> being open and <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> shut, the
steam passes from the boiler into the upper part of the
steam-cylinder, <i>B</i>; and the communication between the
lower part of <i>B</i> and the top of <i>A</i> is also open. Before
starting, steam being shut off from the engine, the great
weight of the pump-rod, <i>X</i>, causes that end of the beam to
preponderate, the pistons standing, as shown, at the top of
their respective steam-cylinders.</p>

<p>The engine being freed from all air by opening all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
valves and permitting the steam to drive it through the engine
and out of the condenser through the &#8220;snifting-valve,&#8221;
<i>O</i>, the valves <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> are closed, and the cock in the exhaust-pipe opened.</p>

<p>The steam beneath the piston of the large cylinder is
immediately condensed, and the pressure on the upper side
of that piston causes it to descend, carrying that end of the
beam with it, and raising the opposite end with the pump-rods
and their attachments. At the same time, the steam
from the lower end of the small high-pressure cylinder being
let into the upper end of the larger cylinder, the completion
of the stroke finds a cylinder full of steam transferred from
the one to the other with corresponding increase of volume
and decrease of pressure. While expanding and diminishing
in pressure as it passes from the smaller into the larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
cylinder, this charge of steam gradually resists less and less
the pressure of the steam from the boiler on the upper side
of the piston of the small cylinder, <i>B</i>, and the net result is
the movement of the engine by pressures exerted on the
upper sides of both pistons and against pressures of less intensity
on the under sides of both. The pressures in the
lower part of the small cylinder, in the upper part of the
large cylinder, and in the communicating passage, are evidently
all equal at any given time.</p>

<p>When the pistons have reached the bottoms of their respective
cylinders, the valves at the top of the small cylinder,
<i>B</i>, and at the bottom of the large cylinder, <i>A</i>, are
closed, and the valves <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are opened. Steam from
the boiler now enters beneath the piston of the small cylinder;
the steam in the larger cylinder is exhausted into
the condenser, and the steam already in the small cylinder
passes over into the large cylinder, following up the piston
as it rises.</p>

<p>Thus, at each stroke a small cylinder full of steam is
taken from the boiler, and the same weight, occupying the
volume of the larger cylinder, is exhausted into the condenser
from the latter cylinder.</p>

<p>Referring to the method of operation of this engine,
Prof. Robison demonstrated that the effect produced was
the same as in Watt&#8217;s single-cylinder engine&mdash;a fact which
is comprehended in the law enunciated many years later by
Rankine, that, &#8220;so far as the theoretical action of the steam
on the piston is concerned, it is immaterial whether the
expansion takes place in one cylinder, or in two or more
cylinders.&#8221; It was found, in practice, that the Hornblower
engine was no more economical than the Watt engine;
and that erected at the Tin Croft Mine, Cornwall, in 1792,
did even less work with the same fuel than the Watt engines.</p>

<p>Hornblower was prosecuted by Boulton &amp; Watt for
infringement. The suit was decided against him, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was imprisoned in default of payment of the royalty, and
fine demanded. He died a disappointed and impoverished
man. The plan thus unsuccessfully introduced by Hornblower
was subsequently modified and adopted by others
among the contemporaries of Watt; and, with higher steam
and the use of the Watt condenser, the &#8220;compound&#8221; gradually
became a standard type of steam-engine.</p>

<p>Arthur Woolf, in 1804, re-introduced the Hornblower or
Falck engine, with its two steam-cylinders, using steam of
higher tension. His first engine was built for a brewery in
London, and a considerable number were subsequently
made. Woolf expanded his steam from six to nine times,
and the pumping-engines built from his plans were said to
have raised about 40,000,000 pounds one foot high per bushel
of coals, when the Watt engine was raising but little more
than 30,000,000. In one case, a duty of 57,000,000 was
claimed.</p>

<p>The most successful of those competitors of Watt who
endeavored to devise a peculiar form of pumping-engine,
which should have the efficiency of that of Boulton &amp; Watt,
and the necessary advantage in first cost, were <span class="smcap">William
Bull</span> and <span class="smcap">Richard Trevithick</span>.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The accompanying
<a href="#Fig38">illustration</a> shows the design, which was then known as
the &#8220;Bull Cornish Engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The steam-cylinder, <i>a</i>, is carried on wooden beams, <i>b</i>,
extending across the engine-house directly over the pump-well.
The piston-rod, <i>c</i>, is secured to the pump-rods,
<i>d d</i>, the cylinder being inverted, and the pumps, <i>e</i>, in the
shaft, <i>f</i>, are thus operated without the intervention of
the beam invariably seen in Watt&#8217;s engines. A connecting-rod,
<i>g</i>, attached to the pump-rod and to the end of a
balance-beam, <i>h</i>, operates the latter, and is counterbalanced
by a weight, <i>i</i>. The rod, <i>j</i>, serves both as a plug-rod and
as an air-pump connecting-rod. A snifting-valve, <i>k</i>, opens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
when the engine is blown through, and relieves the condenser
and air-pump, <i>l</i>, of all air. The rod, <i>m</i>, operates a
solid air-pump piston, the valves of the pump being placed
on either side at the base, instead of in the pump-bucket, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in Watt&#8217;s engines. The condensing-water cistern was a
wooden tank, <i>n</i>. A jet &#8220;pipe-condenser,&#8221; <i>o</i>, was used
instead of a jet condenser of the form adopted by other
makers, and was supplied with water through the cock, <i>p</i>.
The plug-rod, <i>q</i>, as it rises and falls with the pump-rods
and balance-beam, operates the &#8220;gear-handles,&#8221; <i>r r</i>, and
opens and closes the valves, <i>s s</i>, at the required points in
the stroke. The attendant works these valves by hand, in
starting, from the floor, <i>t</i>. The operation of the engine
is similar to that of a Watt engine. It is still in use,
with a few modifications and improvements, and is a very
economical and durable machine. It has not been as generally
adopted, however, as it would probably have been had
not the legal proscription of Watt&#8217;s patents so seriously interfered
with its introduction. Its simplicity and lightness are
decided advantages, and its designers are entitled to great
credit for their boldness and ingenuity, as displayed in their
application of the minor devices which distinguish the engine.
The design is probably to be credited to Bull originally;
but Trevithick built some of these engines, and is
supposed to have greatly improved them while working
with Edward Bull, the son of the inventor, William Bull.
One of these engines was erected by them at the Herland
Mine, Cornwall, in 1798, which had a steam-cylinder
60 inches in diameter, and was built on the plan just described.</p>

<p>Another of the contemporaries of James Watt was a
clergyman, <span class="smcap">Edward Cartwright</span>, the distinguished inventor
of the power-loom, and of the first machine ever used in
combing wool, who revived Watt&#8217;s plan of surface-condensation
in a somewhat modified form. Watt had made a
&#8220;pipe-condenser,&#8221; similar in plan to those now often used,
but had simply immersed it in a tank of water, instead of in
a constantly-flowing stream. Cartwright proposed to use
two concentric cylinders or spheres, between which the
steam entered when exhausted from the cylinder of the engine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and was condensed by contact with the metal surfaces.
Cold water within the smaller and surrounding the exterior
vessel kept the metal cold, and absorbed the heat discharged
by the condensing vapor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig39" id="Fig39"></a>
<img src="images/illo168.png" alt="Cartwright's Engine" width="350" height="453" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Cartwright&#8217;s Engine, 1798.</p></div>

<p>Cartwright&#8217;s engine is best described in the <i>Philosophical
Magazine</i> of June, 1798, from which the accompanying
<a href="#Fig39">sketch</a> is copied.</p>

<p>The object of the inventor is stated to have been to
remedy the defects of the Watt engine&mdash;imperfect vacuum,
friction, and complication.</p>

<p>In the figure, the steam-cylinder takes steam through
the pipe, <i>B</i>. The piston, <i>R</i>, has a rod extending downward
to the smaller pump-piston, <i>G</i>, and upward to the
cross-head, which, in turn, drives the cranks above, by
means of connecting-rods. The shafts thus turned are connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
by a pair of gears, <i>M L</i>, of which one drives a
pinion on the shaft of the fly-wheel. <i>D</i> is the exhaust-pipe
leading to the condenser, <i>F</i>; and the pump, <i>G</i>, removes
the air and water of condensation, forcing it into
the hot-well, <i>H</i>, whence it is returned to the boiler through
the pipe, <i>I</i>. A float in <i>H</i> adjusts an air-valve, so as to
keep a supply of air in the chamber, to serve as a cushion
and to make an air-chamber of the reservoir, and permits
the excess to escape. The large tank contains the water
supplied for condensing the steam.</p>

<p>The piston, <i>R</i>, is made of metal, and is packed with
two sets of cut metal rings, forced out against the sides of
the cylinder by steel springs, the rings being cut at three
points in the circumference, and kept in place by the springs.
The arrangement of the two cranks, with their shafts and
gears, is intended to supersede Watt&#8217;s plan for securing a
perfectly rectilinear movement of the head of the piston-rod,
without friction.</p>

<p>In the accounts given of this engine, great stress is laid
upon the supposed important advantage here offered, by the
introduction of the surface-condenser, of permitting the employment
of a working-fluid other than steam&mdash;as, for example,
alcohol, which is too valuable to be lost. It was
proposed to use the engine in connection with a still, and
thus to effect great economy by making the fuel do double
duty. The only part of the plan which proved both novel
and valuable was the metallic packing and piston, which
has not yet been superseded. The engine itself never came
into use.</p>

<p>At this point, the history of the steam-engine becomes
the story of its applications in several different directions,
the most important of which are the raising of water&mdash;which
had hitherto been its only application&mdash;the locomotive-engine,
the driving of mill-machinery, and steam-navigation.</p>

<p>Here we take leave of James Watt and of his contemporaries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of the former of whom a French author<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
says: &#8220;The
part which he played in the mechanical applications of the
power of steam can only be compared to that of Newton in
astronomy and of Shakespeare in poetry.&#8221; Since the time
of Watt, improvements have been made principally in matters
of mere detail, and in the extension of the range of
application of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>Introductory.&mdash;The commencement of the nineteenth
century found the modern steam-engine fully developed in
all its principal features, and fairly at work in many departments
of industry. The genius of Worcester, and Morland,
and Savery, and Desaguliers, had, in the first period of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
application of the power of steam to useful work, effected a
beginning which, looked upon from a point of view which
exhibits its importance as the first step toward the wonderful
results to-day familiar to every one, appears in its true
light, and entitles those great men to even greater honor
than has been accorded them. The results actually accomplished,
however, were absolutely insignificant in comparison
with those which marked the period of development
just described. Yet even the work of Watt and of his contemporaries
was but a mere prelude to the marvellous advances
made in the succeeding period, to which we are now
come, and, in extent and importance, was insignificant in
comparison with that accomplished by their successors in
the development of all mechanical industries by the application
of the steam-engine to the movement of every kind
of machine.</p>

<p>The first of the two periods of application saw the steam-engine
adapted simply to the elevation of water and the
drainage of mines; during the second period it was adapted
to every variety of useful work, and introduced wherever
the muscular strength of men and animals, or the power of
wind and of falling water, which had previously been the
only motors, had found application. A history of the development
of industries by the introduction of steam-power
during this period, would be no less extended and hardly
less interesting than that of the steam-engine itself.</p>

<p>The way had been fairly opened by Boulton and Watt;
and the year 1800 saw a crowd of engineers and manufacturers
entering upon it, eager to reap the harvest of distinction
and of pecuniary returns which seemed so promising to all.
The last year of the eighteenth century was also the last of
the twenty-five years of partnership of Boulton &amp; Watt,
and, with it, the patents under which that firm had held the
great monopoly of steam-engine building expired. The
right to manufacture the modern steam-engine was common
to all. Watt had, at the commencement of the new century,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
retired from active business-life. Boulton remained
in business; but he was not the inventor of the new engine,
and could not retain, by the exercise of all his remaining
power, the privileges previously held by legal authorization.</p>

<p>The young Boulton and the young Watt were not the
Boulton &amp; Watt of earlier years; and, had they possessed
all of the business talent and all of the inventive genius of
their fathers, they could not have retained control of a business
which was now growing far more rapidly than the facilities
for manufacturing could be extended in any single establishment.
All over the country, and even on the Continent
of Europe, and in America, thousands of mechanics, and
many men of mechanical tastes in other professions, were
familiar with the principles of the new machine, and were
speculating upon its value for all the purposes to which it
has since been applied; and a multitude of enthusiastic mechanics,
and a larger multitude of visionary and ignorant
schemers, were experimenting with every imaginable device,
in the vain hope of attaining perpetual motion, and other
hardly less absurd results, by its modification and improvement.
Steam-engine building establishments sprang up
wherever a mechanic had succeeded in erecting a workshop
and in acquiring a local reputation as a worker in metal,
and many of Watt&#8217;s workmen went out from Soho to take
charge of the work done in these shops. Nearly all of the
great establishments which are to-day most noted for their
extent and for the importance and magnitude of the work
done in them, not only in Great Britain, but in Europe and
the United States, came into existence during this second
period of the application of the steam-engine as a prime
mover.</p>

<p>The new establishments usually grew out of older shops
of a less pretentious character, and were managed by men
who had been trained by Watt, or who had had a still more
awakening experience with those who vainly strove to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
up, by their ingenuity and by great excellence of workmanship,
the advantages possessed at Soho in a legal monopoly
and greater experience in the business.</p>

<p>It was exceedingly difficult to find expert and conscientious
workmen, and machine-tools had not become as thoroughly
perfected as had the steam-engine itself. These
difficulties were gradually overcome, however, and thenceforward
the growth of the business was increasingly rapid.</p>

<p>Every important form of engine had now been invented.
Watt had perfected, with the aid of Murdoch, both the
pumping-engine and the rotative steam-engine for application
to mills. He had invented the trunk engine, and Murdoch
had devised the oscillating engine and the ordinary
slide-valve, and had made a model locomotive-engine, while
Hornblower had introduced the compound engine. The
application of steam to navigation had been often proposed,
and had sometimes been attempted, with sufficient success
to indicate to the intelligent observer an ultimate triumph.
It only remained to extend the use of steam as a motor into
all known departments of industry, and to effect such improvements
in details as experience should prove desirable.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;Leupold&#8217;s Engine, 1720.</p></div>

<p>The engines of Hero, of Porta, and of Branca were, it
will be remembered, non-condensing; but the first plan of a
non-condensing engine that could be made of any really
practical use is given in the &#8220;Theatrum Machinarum&#8221; of
Leupold, published in 1720. This sketch is copied in <a href="#Fig41">Fig.
41</a>. It is stated by Leupold that this plan was suggested
by Papin. It consists of two single-acting cylinders, <i>r s</i>, receiving
steam alternately from the same steam-pipe through
a &#8220;four-way cock,&#8221; <i>x</i>, and exhausting into the atmosphere.
Steam is furnished by the boiler, <i>a</i>, and the pistons, <i>c d</i>,
are alternately raised and depressed, depressing and raising
the pump-rods, <i>k l</i>, to which they are attached by the beams,
<i>h g</i>, vibrating on the centres, <i>i i</i>. The water from the
pumps, <i>o p</i>, is forced up the stand-pipe, <i>q</i>, and discharged
at its top. The alternate action of the steam-pistons is secured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
by turning the &#8220;four-way cock,&#8221; <i>x</i>, first into the position
shown, and then, at the completion of the stroke, into
the reverse position, by which change the steam from the
boiler is then led into the cylinder, <i>s</i>, and the steam in <i>r</i> is
discharged into the atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Leupold states that he is indebted to Papin for the suggestion
of the peculiar valve here used. He also proposed
to use a Savery engine without condensation in raising
water. We have no evidence that this engine was ever
built.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 42.&mdash;Newton&#8217;s Steam-Carriage, 1680.</p></div>

<p>The first rude scheme for applying steam to locomotion
on land was probably that of Isaac Newton, who, in 1680,
proposed the machine shown in the accompanying figure
(<a href="#Fig42">42</a>), which will be recognized as representing the scientific
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
toy which is found in nearly every collection of illustrative
philosophical apparatus. As described in the &#8220;Explanation
of the Newtonian Philosophy,&#8221; it consists of a spherical
boiler, <i>B</i>, mounted on a carriage. Steam issuing from the
pipe, <i>C</i>, seen pointing directly backward, by its reaction

<p>When, at the end of the eighteenth century, the steam-engine
had been so far perfected that the possibility of its
successful application to locomotion had become fully and
very generally recognized, the problem of adapting it to
locomotion on land was attacked by many inventors.</p>

<p>Dr. Robison had, as far back as in 1759, proposed it to
James Watt during one of their conferences, at a time
when the latter was even more ignorant than the former of
the principles which were involved in the construction of the
steam-engine, and this suggestion may have had some influence
in determining Watt to pursue his research; thus setting
in operation that train of thoughtful investigation and
experiment which finally earned for him his splendid fame.</p>

<p>In 1765, that singular genius, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,
whose celebrity was acquired by speculations in poetry and
philosophy as well as in medicine, urged Matthew Boulton&mdash;subsequently
Watt&#8217;s partner, and just then corresponding
with our own Franklin in relation to the use of steam-power&mdash;to
construct a steam-carriage, or &#8220;fiery chariot,&#8221; as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
poetically styled it, and of which he sketched a set of plans.
A young man named Edgeworth became interested in
the scheme, and, in 1768, published a paper which had secured
for him a gold medal from the Society of Arts. In
this paper he proposed railroads on which the carriages
were to be drawn by horses, <i>or by ropes from steam-winding
engines</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Read" id="Read"></a>Nathan Read, of whom an account will be given hereafter,
when describing his attempt to introduce steam-navigation,
planned, and in 1790 obtained a patent for, a steam-carriage,
of which the sketch seen in <a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a> is copied from
the rough drawing accompanying his application. In the

horizontal steering-wheel, with which it is connected by
the ropes or chains, <i>I K</i>, <i>I K</i>; <i>W W</i> are the cocks, which
serve to shut off steam from the engine when necessary, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to determine the amount of steam to be admitted. The
pipes <i>a a</i> are exhaust-pipes, which the inventor proposed
to turn so that they should point backward, in order to secure
the advantage of the effort of reaction of the expelled
steam. (!)</p>

<p>Read made a model steam-carriage, which he exhibited
when endeavoring to secure assistance in furtherance of his
schemes, but seems to have given more attention to steam-navigation,
and nothing was ever accomplished by him in
this direction.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>&mdash;Cugnot&#8217;s Steam-Carriage, 1770.</p></div>

<p>These were merely promising schemes, however. The
first actual experiment was made, as is supposed, by a
French army-officer, <span class="smcap">Nicholas Joseph Cugnot</span>, who in
1769 built a steam-carriage, which was set at work in presence
of the French Minister of War, the Duke de Choiseul.
The funds required by him were furnished by the Compte
de Saxe. Encouraged by the partial success of the first
locomotive, he, in 1770, constructed a second (<a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>),
which is still preserved in the Conservatoire des Arts et
M&eacute;tiers, Paris.</p>

<p>This machine, when recently examined by the author,
was still in an excellent state of preservation. The carriage
and its machinery are substantially built and well-finished,
and exceedingly creditable pieces of work in every respect.
It surprises the engineer to find such evidence of the high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
character of the work of the mechanic Brezin a century ago.
The steam-cylinders were 13 inches in diameter, and the
engine was evidently of considerable power. This locomotive
was intended for the transportation of artillery. It
consists of two beams of heavy timber extending from end
to end, supported by two strong wheels behind, and one still
heavier but smaller wheel in front. The latter carries on
its rim blocks which cut into the soil as the wheel turns,
and thus give greater holding power. The single wheel is
turned by two single-acting engines, one on each side, supplied
with steam by a boiler (seen in the sketch) suspended
in front of the machine. The connection between the engines
and the wheels was effected by means of pawls, as
first proposed by Papin, which could be reversed when it
was desired to drive the machine backward. A seat is
mounted on the carriage-body for the driver, who steers the
machine by a train of gearing, which turns the whole frame,
carrying the machinery 15 or 20 degrees either way. This
locomotive was found to have been built on a tolerably satisfactory
general plan; but the boiler was too small, and
the steering apparatus was incapable of handling the carriage
with promptness.</p>

<p>The death of one of Cugnot&#8217;s patrons, and the exile of
the other, put an end to Cugnot&#8217;s experiments.</p>

<p>Cugnot was a mechanic by choice, and exhibited great
talent. He was a native of Vaud, in Lorraine, where he
was born in 1725. He served both in the French and the
German armies. While under the Mar&eacute;chal de Saxe, he
constructed his first steam locomotive-engine, which only
disappointed him, as he stated, in consequence of the inefficiency
of the feed-pumps. The second was that built under
the authority of the Minister Choiseul, and cost 20,000
livres. Cugnot received from the French Government a
pension of 600 livres. He died in 1804, at the age of seventy-nine
years.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>&mdash;Murdoch&#8217;s Model, 1784.</p></div>

<p>Watt, at a very early period, proposed to apply his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
engine to locomotion, and contemplated using either a non-condensing
engine or an air-surface condenser. He actually
included the locomotive-engine in his patent of 1784; and
his assistant, Murdoch, in the same year, made a working-model
locomotive (<a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>), which was capable of running
at a rapid rate. This model, now deposited in the Patent
Museum at South Kensington, London, had a flue-boiler,
and its steam-cylinder was three-fourths of an inch in diameter,
and the stroke of piston 2 inches. The driving-wheels
were 9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches diameter.</p>

<p>Nothing was, however, done on a larger scale by either
Watt or Murdoch, who both found more than enough to
claim their attention in the construction and introduction
of other engines. Murdoch&#8217;s model is said to have run
from 6 to 8 miles an hour, its little driving-wheels making
from 200 to 275 revolutions per minute. As is seen in the
sketch, this model was fitted with the same form of engine,
known as the &#8220;grasshopper-engine,&#8221; which was used in the
United States by Oliver Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Oliver Evans,&#8221; says Dr. Ernest Alban, the distinguished
German engineer, &#8220;was it reserved to show the true
value of a long-known principle, and to establish thereon a
new and more simple method of applying the power of
steam&mdash;a method that will remain an eternal memorial to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
its introducer.&#8221; Dr. Alban here refers to the earliest permanently
successful introduction of the non-condensing
high-pressure steam-engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Port6" id="Port6"></a>
<img src="images/illo181.png" alt="Evans" width="350" height="444" />
<p class="caption">Oliver Evans.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Port6">Oliver Evans</a></span>, one of the most ingenious mechanics
that America has ever produced, was born at Newport,
Del., in 1755 or 1756, the son of people in very humble
circumstances.</p>

<p>He was, in his youth, apprenticed to a wheelwright, and
soon exhibited great mechanical talent and a strong desire
to acquire knowledge. His attention was, at an early period,
drawn to the possible application of the power of
steam to useful purposes by the boyish pranks of one of his
comrades, who, placing a small quantity of water in a gun-barrel,
and ramming down a tight wad, put the barrel in
the fire of a blacksmith&#8217;s forge. The loud report which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
accompanied the expulsion of the wad was an evidence to
young Evans of great and (as he supposed) previously undiscovered
power.</p>

<p>Subsequently meeting with a description of a Newcomen
engine, he at once noticed that the elastic force of confined
steam was not there utilized. He then designed the non-condensing
engine, in which the power was derived exclusively
from the tension of high-pressure steam, and proposed
its application to the propulsion of carriages.</p>

<p>About the year 1780, Evans joined his brothers, who
were millers by occupation, and at once employed his inventive
talent in improving the details of mill-work, and
with such success as to reduce the cost of attendance one-half,
and also to increase the fineness of the flour made. He
proved himself a very expert millwright.</p>

<p>In 1786 he applied to the Pennsylvania Legislature for
a patent for the application of the steam-engine to driving
mills, and to the steam-carriage, but was refused it. In 1800
or 1801, Evans, after consultation with Professor Robert
Patterson, of the University of Pennsylvania, and getting
his approval of the plans, commenced the construction of a
steam-carriage to be driven by a non-condensing engine.
He soon concluded, however, that it would be a better
scheme, pecuniarily, to adapt his engine, which was novel
in form and of small first cost, to driving mills; and he
accordingly changed his plans, and built an engine of 6
inches diameter of cylinder and 18 inches stroke of piston,
which he applied with perfect success to driving a plaster-mill.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig46" id="Fig46"></a>
<img src="images/illo183.png" alt="Evans's Non-Condensing Engine" width="600" height="339" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>&mdash;Evans&#8217;s Non-condensing Engine, 1800.</p></div>

<p>This engine, which he called the &#8220;Columbian Engine,&#8221;
was of a peculiar form, as seen in <a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a>. The beam is supported
at one end by a rocking column; at the other, it is
attached directly to the piston-rod, while the crank lies beneath
the beam, the connecting-rod, 1, being attached to
the latter at the extreme end. The head of the piston-rod is
compelled to rise and fall in a vertical line by the &#8220;Evans&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
parallelogram&#8221;&mdash;a kind of parallel-motion very similar to
one of those designed by Watt. In the sketch (<a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a>), 2
is the crank, 3 the valve-motion, 4 the steam-pipe from the
boiler, <i>E</i>, 5 6 7 the feed-pipe leading from the pump, <i>F</i>.
<i>A</i> is the boiler. The flame from the fire on the grate, <i>H</i>,
passes under the boiler between brick walls, and back
through a central flue to the chimney, <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Evans continued to extend the applications
of his engine and to perfect its details; and, others
following in his track, the non-condensing engine is to-day
fulfilling the predictions which he made 70 years ago, when
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that my engines will propel boats
against the current of the Mississippi, and wagons on turnpike
roads, with great profit....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time will come when people will travel in stages
moved by steam-engines from one city to another, almost
as fast as birds can fly, 15 or 20 miles an hour.... A carriage
will start from Washington in the morning, the passengers
will breakfast at Baltimore, dine at Philadelphia,
and sup in New York the same day....</p>

<p>&#8220;Engines will drive boats 10 or 12 miles an hour, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
there will be hundreds of steamers running on the Mississippi,
as predicted years ago.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig47" id="Fig47"></a>
<img src="images/illo184.png" alt="Oruktor Amphibolis" width="400" height="251" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;Evans&#8217;s &#8220;Oruktor Amphibolis,&#8221; 1804.</p></div>

<p>In 1804, Evans applied one of his engines in the transportation
of a large flat-bottomed craft, built on an order
of the Board of Health of Philadelphia, for use in clearing
some of the docks along the water-front of the city. Mounting
it on wheels, he placed in it one of his 5-horse power
engines, and named the odd machine (<a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>) &#8220;Oruktor
Amphibolis.&#8221; This steam dredging-machine, weighing
about 40,000 pounds, was then propelled very slowly from
the works, up Market Street, around to the Water-Works, and
then launched into the Schuylkill. The engine was then
applied to the paddle-wheel at the stern, and drove the
craft down the river to its confluence with the Delaware.</p>

<p>In September of the same year, Evans laid before the
Lancaster Turnpike Company a statement of the estimated
expenses and profits of steam-transportation on the common
road, assuming the size of the carriage used to be sufficient
for transporting 100 barrels of flour 50 miles in 24 hours,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and placed in competition with 10 wagons drawn by 5
horses each.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Fig47">sketch</a> above given of the &#8220;Oruktor Amphibolis,&#8221;
the engine is seen to resemble that previously described.
The wheel, <i>A</i>, is driven by a rod depending from the end
of a beam, <i>B&#8242; B</i>, the other end of which is supported at <i>E</i>
by the frame, <i>E F G</i>. The body of the machine is carried
on wheels, <i>K K</i>, driven by belts, <i>M M</i>, from the pulley on
the shaft carrying <i>A</i>. The paddle-wheel is seen at <i>W</i>.
Evans had some time previously sent Joseph Sampson to
England with copies of his plans, and by him they were
shown to Trevithick, Vivian, and other British engineers.</p>

<p>Among other devices, the now familiar Cornish boiler,
having a single internal flue, and the Lancashire boiler,
having a pair of internal flues, were planned and used by
Evans.</p>

<p>At about the time that he was engaged on his steam
dredging-machine, Evans communicated with Messrs. McKeever
&amp; Valcourt, who contracted with him to build an
engine for a steam-vessel to ply between New Orleans and
Natchez on the Mississippi, the hull of the vessel to be built
on the river, and the machinery to be sent to the first-named
city to be set up in the boat. Financial difficulties
and low water combined to prevent the completion of the
steamer, and the engine was set at work driving a saw-mill,
where, until the mill was destroyed by fire, it sawed lumber
at the rate of 250 feet of boards per hour.</p>

<p>Evans never succeeded in accomplishing in America as
great a success as had rewarded Watt in Great Britain; but
he continued to build steam-engines to the end of his life,
April 19, 1819, and was succeeded by his sons-in-law, James
Rush and David Muhlenberg.</p>

<p>He exhibited equal intelligence and ingenuity in perfecting
the processes of milling, and in effecting improvements
in his own business, that of the millwright. When but
twenty-four years old, he invented a machine for making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the wire teeth used in cotton and woolen cards, turning
them out at the rate of 3,000 per minute. A little later he
invented a card-setting machine, which cut the wire from
the reel, bent the teeth, and inserted them. In milling, he
invented a whole series of machines and attachments, including
the elevator, the &#8220;conveyor,&#8221; the &#8220;hopper-box,&#8221; the
&#8220;drill,&#8221; and the &#8220;descender,&#8221; and enabled the miller to
make finer flour, gaining over 20 pounds to the barrel, and
to do this at half the former cost of attendance. The introduction
of his improvements into Ellicott&#8217;s mills, near
Baltimore, where 325 barrels of flour were made per day,
was calculated to have saved nearly $5,000 per year in cost
of labor, and over $30,000 by increasing the production.
He wrote &#8220;The Young Steam-Engineer&#8217;s Guide,&#8221; and a
work which remained standard many years after his death,
&#8220;The Young Millwright&#8217;s Guide.&#8221; Less fortunate than his
transatlantic rival, he was nevertheless equally deserving
of fame. He has sometimes been called &#8220;The Watt of
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>The application of steam to locomotion on the common
road was much more successful in Great Britain than in the
United States. As early as 1786, William Symmington,
subsequently more successful in his efforts to introduce
steam for marine propulsion, assisted by his father, made a
working model of a steam-carriage, which did not, however,
lead to important results.</p>

<p>In 1802, Richard Trevithick, a pupil of Murdoch&#8217;s, who
afterward became well known in connection with the introduction
of railroads, made a model steam-carriage, which
was patented in the same year. The model may still be
seen in the Patent Museum at South Kensington.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a
href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In this engine, high-pressure steam was employed, and
the condenser was dispensed with. The boiler was of the
form devised by Evans, and was subsequently generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
used in Cornwall, where it was called the &#8220;Trevithick
Boiler.&#8221; The engine had but one cylinder, and the piston-rod
drove a &#8220;cross-tail,&#8221; working in guides, which was connected
with a &#8220;cross-head&#8221; on the opposite side of the shaft
by two &#8220;side-rods.&#8221; The connecting-rod was attached to
the cross-head and the crank, &#8220;returning&#8221; toward the cylinder
as the shaft lay between the latter and the cross-head.
This was probably the first example of the now common
&#8220;return connecting-rod engine.&#8221; The connection between
the crank-shaft and the wheels of the carriage was effected
by gearing. The valve-gear and the feed-pumps were
worked from the engine-shaft. The inventor proposed to
secure his wheels against slipping by projecting bolts, when
necessary, through the rim of the wheel into the ground.
The first carriage of full size was built by Trevithick and
Vivian at Camborne, in 1803, and, after trial, was taken to
London, where it was exhibited to the public. <i>En route</i>,
it was driven by its own engines to Plymouth, 90 miles
from Camborne, and then shipped by water. It is not
known whether the inventor lost faith in his invention; but
he very soon dismantled the machine, sold the engine and
carriage separately, and returned to Cornwall, where he
soon began work on a railroad-locomotive.</p>

<p>In 1821, Julius Griffiths, of Brompton, Middlesex, England,
patented a steam-carriage for the transportation of
passengers on the highway. His first road-locomotive was
built in the same year by Joseph Bramah, one of the ablest
mechanics of his time. The frame of the carriage carried a
large double coach-body between the two axles, and the
machinery was mounted over and behind the rear axle.
One man was stationed on a rear platform, to manage the
engine and to attend to the fire, and another, stationed in
front of the body of the coach, handled the steering-wheel.
The boiler was composed of horizontal water-tubes and
steam-tubes, the latter being so situated as to receive heat
from the furnace-gases <i>en route</i> to the chimney, and thus to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
act as a superheater. The wheels were driven, by means
of intermediate gearing, by two steam-engines, which, with
their attachments, were suspended on helical springs, to
prevent injury by jars and shocks. An air-surface condenser
was used, consisting of flattened thin metal tubes,
cooled by the contact of the external air, and discharging
the water of condensation, as it accumulated within them,
into a feed-pump, which, in turn, forced it into the lowest
row of tubes in the boiler.</p>

<p>The boiler did not prove large enough for continuous
work; but the carriage was used experimentally, now and
then, for a number of years.</p>

<p>During the succeeding ten years the adaptation of the
steam-engine to land-transportation continued to attract
more and more attention, and experimental road-engines
were built with steadily-increasing frequency. The defects
of these engines revealing themselves on trial, they were
one by one remedied, and the road-locomotive gradually
assumed a shape which was mechanically satisfactory. Their
final introduction into general use seemed at one time only
a matter of time; their non-success was due to causes over
which the legislator and the general public, and not the engineer,
had control, as well as to the development of steam-transportation
on a rival plan.</p>

<p>In 1822, David Gordon patented a road-engine, but it
is not known whether it was ever built. At about the same
time, Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney, who subsequently took an
active part in their introduction, stated, in his lectures, that
&#8220;elementary power is capable of being applied to propel
carriages along common roads with great political advantage,
and the floating knowledge of the day places the object
within reach.&#8221; He made an ammonia-engine&mdash;probably
the first ever made&mdash;and worked it so successfully, that
he made use of it in driving a little locomotive.</p>

<p>Two years later, Gordon patented a curious arrangement,
which, however, had been proposed twelve years earlier by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Brunton, and was again proposed afterward by Gurney, and
others. This consisted in fitting to the engine a set of
jointed legs, imitating, as nearly as the inventor could make
them, the action of a horse&#8217;s legs and feet. Such an arrangement
was actually experimented with until it was
found that they could not be made to work satisfactorily,
when it was also found that they were not needed.</p>

<p>During the same season, Burstall &amp; Hill made a steam-carriage,
and made many unsuccessful attempts to introduce
their plan. The engine used was like that of Evans, except
that the steam-cylinder was placed at the end of the
beam, and the crank-shaft under the middle. The front
and rear wheels were connected by a longitudinal shaft and
bevel gearing. The boiler was found to have the usual defect,
and would only supply steam for a speed of three or
four miles an hour. The result was a costly failure. W.
H. James, of London, in 1824-&#8217;25, proposed several devices
for placing the working parts, as well as the body of the
carriage, on springs, without interfering with their operation,
and the Messrs. Seaward patented similar devices.
Samuel Brown, in 1826, introduced a gas-engine, in which
the piston was driven by the pressure produced by the
combustion of gas, and a vacuum was secured by the condensation
of the resulting vapor. Brown built a locomotive
which he propelled by this engine. He ascended Shooter&#8217;s
Hill, near London, and the principal cause of his ultimate
failure seems to have been the cost of operating the engine.</p>

<p>From this date forward, during several years, a number
of inventors and mechanics seem to have devoted their
whole time to this promising scheme. Among them, Burstall
&amp; Hill, Gurney, Ogle &amp; Summers, Sir Charles Dance,
and Walter Hancock, were most successful.</p>

<p>Gurney, in the year 1827, built a steam-carriage, which
he kept at work nearly two years in and about London, and
sometimes making long journeys. On one occasion he made
the journey from Meksham to Cranford Bridge, a distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of 85 miles, in 10 hours, including all stops. He used the
mechanical legs previously adopted by Brunton and by
Gordon, but omitted this rude device in those engines subsequently
built.</p>

<p>Gurney&#8217;s engine of 1828 is of interest to the engineer as
exhibiting a very excellent arrangement of machinery, and
as having one of the earliest of &#8220;sectional boilers.&#8221; The
latter was of peculiar form, and differed greatly in design
from the sectional boiler invented a quarter of a century
earlier by John Stevens, in the United States.</p>

<p>In the sketch (<a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>) this boiler is seen at the right.
It was composed of bent <span class="fsize125"><b>&#9665;</b></span>-shaped tubes, <i>a a</i>, connected to
two cylinders, <i>b b</i>, the upper one of which was a steam-chamber.
Vertical tubes connected these two chambers,
and permitted a complete and regular circulation of the
water. A separate reservoir, called a separator, <i>d</i>, was connected
with these chambers by pipes, as shown. From the
top of this separator a steam-pipe, <i>e e e</i>, conveyed steam to the
engine-cylinders at <i>f</i>. The cranks, <i>g</i>, on the rear axle were
turned by the engines, and the eccentric, <i>h</i>, on the axle drove
the valve-gearing and the valve, <i>i</i>. The link, <i>k l</i>, being
moved by a line, <i>l l</i>, led from the driver&#8217;s seat, the carriage
was started, stopped, or reversed, by throwing the upper end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of the link into gear with the valve-stem, by setting the
link midway between its upper and lower positions, or by
raising it until the lower end, coming into action on the
valve-stem, produced a reverse motion of the valve. The
pin on which this link vibrated is seen at the centre of its
elliptical strap. The throttle-valve, <i>o</i>, by which the supply
of steam to the engine was adjusted, was worked by the lever,
<i>n</i>. The exhaust-pipe, <i>p</i>, led to the tank, <i>q</i>, and the uncondensed
vapor passed to the chimney, <i>s s</i>, by the pipe, <i>r r</i>.
The force-pump, <i>u</i>, taking feed-water from the tank, <i>t</i>, supplied
it to the boiler by the pipe, <i>x x x</i>, which, <i>en route</i>, was
coiled up to form a &#8220;heater&#8221; directly above the boiler. The
supply was regulated by the cock, <i>y</i>. The attendant had a
seat at <i>z</i>. A blast-apparatus, 1, was driven by an independent
engine, 2 3, and produced a forced blast, which was
led to the boiler-furnace through the air-duct, 5 5; 4 4 represents
the steam-pipe to the little blowing-engine. The
steering-wheel, 6, was directed by a lever, 7, and the change
of direction of the perch, 8, which turned about a king-bolt
at 9, gave the desired direction to the forward wheels and
to the carriage.</p>

<p>This seems to have been one of the best designs brought
out at that time. The boiler, built to carry 70 pounds, was
safe and strong, and was tested up to 800 pounds pressure.
A forced draught was provided. The engines were well
placed, and of good design. The valve was arranged to
work the steam with expansion from half-stroke. The feed-water
was heated, and the steam slightly superheated. The
boiler here used has been since reproduced under new names
by later inventors, and is still used with satisfactory results.
Modifications of the &#8220;pipe-boiler&#8221; were made by several
other makers of steam-carriages also. Anderson &amp; James
made their boilers of lap-welded iron tubes of one inch internal
diameter and one-fifth inch thick, and claimed for
them perfect safety. Such tubes should have sufficient
strength to sustain a pressure of 20,000 pounds per square<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
inch. If made of such good iron as the makers claimed to
have put into them, &#8220;which worked like lead,&#8221; they would,
as was also claimed, when ruptured, open by tearing, and
discharge their contents without producing the usual disastrous
consequences of boiler explosions.</p>

<p>The primary principle of the sectional boiler was then
well understood. The boilers of Ogle &amp; Summers were
made up of pairs of upright tubes, set one within the other,
the intervening space being filled with water and steam, and
the flame passing through the inner and around the outer
tube of each pair.</p>

<p>One of the engines of Sir James Anderson and W. H.
James was built in 1829. It had two 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>-inch steam-cylinders,
driving the rear wheels independently. In James&#8217;s
earlier plan of 1824-&#8217;25, a pair of cylinders was attached to
each of the two halves into which the rear axle was divided,
and were arranged to drive cranks set at right-angles with
each other. The later machine weighed 3 tons, and carried
15 passengers, on a rough graveled road across the Epping
Forest, at the rate of from 12 to 15 miles per hour. Steam
was carried at 300 pounds. Several tubes gave way in the
welds, but the carriage returned, carrying 24 passengers at
the rate of 7 miles per hour. On a later trial, with new
boilers, the carriage again made 15 miles per hour. It was,
however, subject to frequent accidents, and was finally
withdrawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Hancock</span> was the most successful and persevering
of all those who attempted the introduction of steam
on the common road. He had, in 1827, patented a boiler
of such peculiar form, that it deserves description. It consisted
of a collection of flat chambers, of which the walls
were of boiler-plate. These chambers were arranged side
by side, and connected laterally by tubes and stays, and all
were connected by short vertical tubes to a horizontal large
pipe placed across the top of the boiler-casing, and serving
as a steam-drum or separator. This earliest of &#8220;sheet flue-boilers&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
did excellent service on Hancock&#8217;s steam-carriages,
where experience showed that there was little or no danger
of disruptive explosions.</p>

<p>Hancock&#8217;s first steam-carriage was mounted on three
wheels, the leading-wheel arranged to swivel on a king-bolt,
and driven by a pair of oscillating cylinders connected with
its axle, which was &#8220;cranked&#8221; for the purpose. The engines
turned with the steering-wheel. This carriage was
by no means satisfactory, but it was used for a long time,
and traveled many hundreds of miles without once failing
to do the work assigned it.</p>

<p>By this time there were a half-dozen steam-carriages
under construction for Hancock, for Ogle &amp; Summers, and
for Sir Charles Dance.</p>

<p>In 1831, Hancock placed a new carriage on a route between
London and Stratford, where it ran regularly for
hire. Dance, in the same season, started another on the
line between Cheltenham and Gloucester, where it ran from
February 21st to June 22d, traveling 3,500 miles and carrying
3,000 passengers, running the 9 miles in 55 minutes
usually, and sometimes in three-quarters of an hour, and
never meeting with an accident, except the breakage of an
axle in running over heaps of stones which had been purposely
placed on the road by enemies of the new system of
transportation. Ogle &amp; Summers&#8217;s carriage attained a
speed, as testified by Ogle before a committee of the House
of Commons, of from 32 to 35 miles an hour, and on a rising
grade, near Southampton, at 24<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles per hour. They
carried 250 pounds of steam, ran 800 miles, and met with
no accident. Colonel Macerone, in 1833, ran a steam-carriage
of his own design from London to Windsor and back,
with 11 passengers, a distance of 23<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles, in 2 hours. Sir
Charles Dance, in the same year, ran his carriage 16 miles
an hour, and made long excursions at the rate of 9 miles an
hour. Still another experimenter, Heaton, ascended Lickey
Hill, between Worcester and Birmingham, on gradients of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
one in eight and one in nine, in places; this was considered
one of the worst pieces of road in England. The carriage
towed a coach containing 20 passengers.</p>

<p>Of all these, and many others, Hancock, however, had
most marked success. His coach, called the &#8220;Infant,&#8221;
which was set at work in February, 1831, was, a year later,
plying between London &#8220;City&#8221; and Paddington. Another,
called the &#8220;Era,&#8221; was built for the London and Greenwich
Steam-Carriage Company, which was mechanically a success.
The company, however, was financially unsuccessful.
In October, 1832, the &#8220;Infant&#8221; ran to Brighton from London,
carrying a party of 11, at the rate of 9 miles per hour,
ascending Redhill at a speed of 5 miles. They steamed 38
miles the first day, stopping at night at Hazledean, and
reached Brighton next day, running 11 miles per hour.
Returning with 15 passengers, the coach ran 1 mile in less
than 4 minutes, and made 10 miles in 55 minutes. A run
from Stratford to Brighton was made in less than 10 hours,
at an average speed of 12 miles an hour running time, the
actual running time being less than 6 hours. The next
year another carriage, the &#8220;Enterprise,&#8221; was put on the
road to Paddington by Hancock for another company, and
ran regularly over two weeks; but this company was also
unsuccessful. In the summer of 1833 he brought out still
another steam-coach, the &#8220;Autopsy&#8221; (<a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>), which he
ran to Brighton, and then, returning to London, man&oelig;uvred
the carriage in the crowded streets without difficulty or accident.
He went about the streets of London at all times,
and without hesitation. The coach next ran between Finsbury
Square and Pentonville regularly for four weeks, without
accident or delay. In the sketch, a part of the side is
broken away to show the machinery. The boiler, <i>A B</i>,
supplies steam through the steam-pipe, <i>H K</i>, to the steam-engine,
<i>C D</i>, which is coupled to the crank-shaft, <i>F</i>. <i>E</i> is
the feed-pump. The rear axle is turned by the endless
chain seen connecting it with the engine-shaft, and the rear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
wheels, <i>S</i>, are thus driven. A blower, <i>T</i>, gives a forced
draught. The driver sits at <i>M</i>, steering by the wheel, <i>N</i>,
which is coupled to the larger wheel, <i>P</i>, and thus turns the
forward axle into any desired position. In 1834, Hancock
built a steam &#8220;drag&#8221; on an Austrian order, which, carrying
10 persons and towing a coach containing 6 passengers,
was driven through the city beyond Islington, making 14
miles an hour on a level, and 8 miles or more on rising
ground. In the same year he built the &#8220;Era,&#8221; and, in August,
put the &#8220;Autopsy&#8221; on with it, to make a steam-line
to Paddington. These coaches ran until the end of November,
carrying 4,000 passengers, at a usual rate of speed of
12 miles per hour. He then sent the &#8220;Era&#8221; to Dublin,
where, on one occasion, it ran 18 miles per hour.</p>

<p>In 1835 a large carriage, the &#8220;Erin,&#8221; was completed,
which was intended to carry 20 passengers. It towed three
omnibuses and a stage-coach, with 50 passengers, on a level
road, at the speed of 10 miles an hour. It drew an omnibus
with 18 passengers through Whitehall, Charing Cross, and
Regent Street, and out to Brentford, running 14 miles an
hour. It ran also to Reading, making 38 miles, with the
same load, in 3 hours and 8 minutes running time. The
stops <i>en route</i> occupied a half-hour. The same carriage
made 75 miles to Marlborough in 7<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
hours running time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
stopping 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> hours on the road, in consequence of having
left the tender and supplies behind.</p>

<p>In May, 1836, Hancock put all his carriages on the Paddington
road, and ran regularly for over five months, running
4,200 miles in 525 trips to Islington, 143 to Paddington,
and 44 to Stratford, passing through the city over 200
times. The carriages averaged 5 hours and 17 or 18 minutes
daily running time. A light steam-phaeton, built in 1838,
for his own use, made 20 miles an hour, and was driven
about the city, and among horses and carriages, without
causing annoyance or danger. Its usual speed was about
10 miles an hour. Altogether, Hancock built nine steam-carriages,
capable of carrying 116 passengers in addition
to the regular attendants.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In December, 1833, about 20 steam-carriages and traction
road-engines were running, or were in course of construction,
in and near London. In our own country, the
roughness of roads discouraged inventors; and in Great
Britain even, the successful introduction of road-locomotives,
which seemed at one time almost an accomplished
fact, finally met with so many obstacles, that even Hancock,
the most ingenious, persistent, and successful constructor,
gave up in despair. Hostile legislation procured by opposing
interests, and the rapid progress of steam-locomotion on
railroads, caused this result.</p>

<p>In consequence of this interruption of experiment, almost
nothing was done during the succeeding quarter of a
century, and it is only within a few years that anything like
a business success has been founded upon the construction
of road-locomotives, although the scheme seems to have
been at no time entirely given up.</p>

<p>The opposition of coach-proprietors, and of all classes
having an interest in the old lines of coaches, was most determined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and the feeling evinced by them was intensely
bitter; but the advocates of the new system of transportation
were equally determined and persevering, and, having
right on their side, and the pecuniary advantage of the
public as their object, they would probably have succeeded
ultimately, except for the introduction of the still better
method of transportation by rail.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1831, when the war between the two
parties was at its height, a committee of the British House
of Commons made a very complete investigation of the
subject. This committee reported that they had become
convinced that &#8220;the substitution of inanimate for animal
power, in draught on common roads, is one of the most important
improvements in the means of internal communication
ever introduced.&#8221; They considered its practicability
to have been &#8220;fully established,&#8221; and predicted that its
introduction would &#8220;take place more or less rapidly, in proportion
as the attention of scientific men shall be drawn, by
public encouragement, to further improvement.&#8221; The success
of the system had, as they stated, been retarded by
prejudice, adverse interests, and prohibitory tolls; and the
committee remark: &#8220;When we consider that these trials
have been made under the most unfavorable circumstances,
at great expense, in total uncertainty, without any of those
guides which experience has given to other branches of engineering;
that those engaged in making them are persons
looking solely to their own interests, and not theorists
attempting the perfection of ingenious models; when we
find them convinced, after long experience, that they are
introducing such a mode of conveyance as shall tempt the
public, by its superior advantages, from the use of the
admirable lines of coaches which have been generally established,
it surely cannot be contended that the introduction
of steam-carriages on common roads is, as yet, an uncertain
experiment, unworthy of legislative attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farey, one of the most distinguished mechanical engineers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of the time, testified that he considered the practicability
of such a system as fully established, and that the result
would be its general adoption. Gurney had run his carriage
between 20 and 30 miles an hour; Hancock could sustain a
speed of 10 miles; Ogle had run his coach 32 to 35 miles
an hour, and ascended a hill rising 1 in 6 at the speed of
24<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles. Summers had traveled up a hill having a gradient
of 1 in 12, with 19 passengers, at the rate of speed of
15 miles per hour; he had run 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> hours at 30 miles an hour.
Farey thought that steam-coaches would be found to cost
one-third as much as the stage-coaches in use. The steam-carriages
were reported to be safer than those drawn by
horses, and far more manageable; and the construction of
boilers adopted&mdash;the &#8220;sectional&#8221; boiler, as it is now called&mdash;completely
insured against injury by explosion, and the
dangers and inconveniences arising from the frightening of
horses had proved to be largely imaginary. The wear and
tear of roads were found to be less than with horses, while
with broad wheel-tires the carriages acted beneficially as
road-rollers. The committee finally concluded:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. That carriages can be propelled by steam on common
roads at an average rate of 10 miles per hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. That at this rate they have conveyed upward of 14
passengers.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. That their weight, including engine, fuel, water,
and attendants, may be under three tons.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. That they can ascend and descend hills of considerable
inclination with facility and safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. That they are perfectly safe for passengers.</p>

<p>&#8220;6. That they are not (or need not be, if properly constructed)
nuisances to the public.</p>

<p>&#8220;7. That they will become a speedier and cheaper mode
of conveyance than carriages drawn by horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;8. That, as they admit of greater breadth of tire than
other carriages, and as the roads are not acted on so injuriously
as by the feet of horses in common draught, such carriages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
will cause less wear of roads than coaches drawn by
horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;9. That rates of toll have been imposed on steam-carriages,
which would prohibit their being used on several
lines of road, were such charges permitted to remain unaltered.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Railroad</span>, which now, by the adaptation of steam
to the propulsion of its carriages, became the successful
rival of the system of transportation of which an account
has just been given, was not a new device. It, like all
other important changes of method and great inventions,
had been growing into form for ages. The ancients were
accustomed to lay down blocks of stone as a way upon
which their heavily-loaded wagons could be drawn with less
resistance than on the common road. This practice was
gradually so modified as to result in the adoption of the
now universally-practised methods of paving and road-making.
The old tracks, bearing the marks of heavy traffic, are
still seen in the streets of the unearthed city of Pompeii.</p>

<p>In the early days of mining in Great Britain, the coal
or the ore was carried from the mine to the vessel in which
it was to be embarked in sacks on the backs of horses.
Later, the miners laid out wagon-roads, and used carts and
wagons drawn by horses, and the roads were paved with
stone along the lines traversed by the wheels of the vehicles.
Still later (about 1630), heavy planks or squared timber
took the place of the stone, and were introduced into
the north of England by a gentleman of the name of Beaumont,
who had transferred his property there from the
south. A half century later, the system had become generally
introduced. By the end of the eighteenth century the
construction of these &#8220;tram-ways&#8221; had become well-understood,
and the economy which justified the expenditure of
considerable amounts of money in making cuts and in filling,
to bring the road to a uniform grade, had become well-recognized.
Arthur Young, writing at this time, says the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
coal wagon-roads were &#8220;great works, carried over all sorts
of inequalities of ground, so far as the distance of nine or
ten miles,&#8221; and that, on these tram-ways of timber, &#8220;one
horse is able to draw, and that with ease, fifty or sixty
bushels of coals.&#8221; The wagon-wheels were of cast-iron, and
made with grooved rims, which fitted the rounded tops of
the wooden rails. But these wooden rails were found subject
to rapid decay, and at Whitehaven, in 1738, they were
protected from wear by cast-iron plates laid upon them, and
this improvement rapidly became known and adopted. A
tram-road, laid down at Sheffield for the Duke of Norfolk,
in 1776, was made by laying angle-bars of cast-iron on longitudinal
sleepers of timber; another, built by William
Jessup in Leicestershire, in 1789, had an edge-rail, and the
wheels were made with flanges, like those used to-day. The
coned &#8220;tread&#8221; of the wheel, which prevents wear of flanges
and reduces resistance, was the invention of James Wright,
of Columbia, Pa., 40 years later. The modern railroad was
simply the result of this gradual improvement of the permanent
way, and the adaptation of the steam-engine to the
propulsion of its wagons.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore,
the steam-engine had been given a form which permitted
its use, and the railroad had been so far perfected that there
were no difficulties to be anticipated in the construction of
the permanent way, and inventors were gradually preparing,
as has been seen, to combine these two principal elements
into one system. Railroads had been introduced in
all parts of Great Britain, some of them of considerable
length, and involving the interests of so many private individuals
that they were necessarily constructed under the
authorization of legal enactments. In the year 1805 the
Merstham Railway was opened to traffic, and it is stated
that on that occasion one horse drew a train of 12 wagons,
carrying 38 tons of stone, on a &#8220;down gradient&#8221; of 1 in 120,
at the rate of 6 miles per hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span><span class="smcap"><a href="#Port7">Richard
Trevithick</a></span> was the first engineer to apply
steam-power to the haulage of loads on the railroad. Trevithick
was a Cornishman by birth, a native of Redruth.
He was naturally a skillful mechanic, and was placed by his
father with Watt&#8217;s assistant, Murdoch, who was superintending
the erection of pumping-engines in Cornwall; and
from that ingenious and accomplished engineer young Trevithick
probably acquired both the skill and the knowledge
which, with his native talent, enterprise, and industry, enabled
him to accomplish the work which has made him famous.
He was soon intrusted with the erection and management
of large pumping-engines, and subsequently went into the
business of constructing steam-engines with another engineer,
Edward Bull, who took an active part, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Hornblowers and others, in opposing the Boulton &amp; Watt
patents. The termination of the suits which established the
validity of Watt&#8217;s patent put an end to their business, and
Trevithick looked about for other work, and, not long
after, entered into partnership with a relative, Andrew
Vivian, who was also a skillful mechanic; they together designed
and patented the steam-carriage already referred to.
Its success was sufficiently satisfactory to awaken strong
confidence of a perfect success on the now common tram-roads;
and Trevithick, in February, 1804, had completed a
&#8220;locomotive&#8221; engine to work on the Welsh Pen-y-darran
road. This engine (<a href="#Fig50">Fig. 50</a>) had a cylindrical flue-boiler,
<i>A</i>, like that designed by Oliver Evans, and a single steam-cylinder,
<i>B</i>, set vertically into the steam-space of the boiler,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and driving the outside cranks, <i>L</i>, on the rear axle of the
engine by very long connecting-rods, <i>D</i>, attached to its
cross-head at <i>E</i>. The guide-bars, <i>I</i>, were stayed by braces
leading to the opposite end of the boiler. No attempt
was made to condense the exhaust-steam, which was discharged
into the smoke-pipe. The pressure of steam
adopted was 40 pounds per square inch; but Trevithick
had already made a number of non-condensing engines on
which he carried from 50 to 145 pounds pressure.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span>&mdash;Trevithick&#8217;s Locomotive, 1804.</p></div>

<p>In the year 1808, Trevithick built a railroad in London,
on what was known later as Torrington Square, or Euston
Square, and set at work a steam-carriage, which he called
&#8220;Catch-me-who-can.&#8221; This was a very plain and simple
machine. The steam-cylinder was set vertically in the
after-end of the boiler, and the cross-head was connected to
two rods, one on either side, driving the hind pair of wheels.
The exhaust-steam entered the chimney, aiding the draught.
This engine, weighing about 10 tons, made from 12 to 15
miles an hour on the circular railway in London, and was
said by its builder to be capable of making 20 miles an hour.
The engine was finally thrown from the track, after some
weeks of work, by the breaking of a rail, and, Trevithick&#8217;s
funds having been expended, it was never replaced. This
engine had a steam-cylinder 14<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter, and a
stroke of piston of 4 feet. Trevithick used no device to aid
the friction of the wheels on the rails in giving pulling-power,
and seems to have understood that none was needed.
This plan of working a locomotive-engine without such
complications as had been proposed by other engineers was,
however, subsequently patented, in 1813, by Blackett &amp;
Hedley. The latter was at one time Trevithick&#8217;s agent,
and was director of Wylam Colliery, of which Mr. Blackett
was proprietor.</p>

<p>Trevithick applied his high-pressure non-conducting engine
not only to locomotives, but to every purpose that opportunity
offered him. He put one into the Tredegar Iron-Works,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to drive the puddle-train, in 1801. This engine had
a steam-cylinder 28 inches in diameter, and 6 feet stroke of
piston; a boiler of cast-iron, 6<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> feet in diameter and 20 feet
long, with a wrought-iron internal tube, 3 feet in diameter
at the furnace-end and 24 inches beyond the furnace. The
steam-pressure ranged from 50 to 100 pounds per square
inch. The valve was a four-way cock. The exhaust-steam
was carried into the chimney, passing through a feed-water
heater <i>en route</i>. This engine was taken down in 1856.<a name="FNanchor_48_48"
id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In 1803, Trevithick applied his engine to driving rock-drills,
and three years later made a large contract with the
Trinity Board for dredging in the Thames, and constructed
steam dredging-machines for the work, of the form which
is still most generally used in Great Britain, although rarely
seen in the United States&mdash;the &#8220;chain-and-bucket dredger.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later, Trevithick was engaged upon the first and
unsuccessful attempt to carry a tunnel under the Thames, at
London; but no sooner had that costly scheme been given
up, than he returned to his favorite pursuits, and continued
his work on interrupted schemes for ship-propulsion. Trevithick
at last left England, spent some years in South America,
and finally returned home and died in extreme poverty,
April, 1833, at the age of sixty-two, without having
succeeded in accomplishing the general introduction of any
of his inventions.</p>

<p>Trevithick was characteristically an inventor of the typical
sort. He invented many valuable devices, but brought
but few into even experimental use, and reaped little advantage
from any of them. He was ingenious, a thorough mechanic,
bold, active, and indefatigable; but his lack of persistence
made his whole life, as Smiles has said, &#8220;but a
series of beginnings.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is at about this period that we find evidence of the
intelligent labors of another of our own countrymen&mdash;one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
who, in consequence of the unobtrusive manner in which
his work was done, has never received the full credit to
which he is entitled.</p>

<p class="caption">Colonel John Stevens.</p></div>

<p><a name="Stevens" id="Stevens"></a><span class="smcap">Colonel John Stevens</span>, of Hoboken, as he is generally
called, was born in the city of New York, in 1749; but
throughout his business-life he was a resident of New Jersey.</p>

<p>His attention is said to have been first called to the application
of steam-power by seeing the experiments of John
Fitch with his steamer on the Delaware, and he at once devoted
himself to the introduction of steam-navigation with
characteristic energy, and with a success that will be indicated
when we come to the consideration of that subject.</p>

<p>But this far-sighted engineer and statesman saw plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the importance of applying the steam-engine to land-transportation
as well as to navigation; and not only that, but
he saw with equal distinctness the importance of a well-devised
and carefully-prosecuted scheme of internal communication
by a complete system of railroads. In 1812 he
published a pamphlet containing &#8220;Documents tending to
prove the superior advantages of Railways and Steam-Carriages
over Canal-Navigation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> At this time, the only
locomotive in the world was that of Trevithick and Vivian,
at Merthyr Tydvil, and the railroad itself had not grown
beyond the old wooden tram-roads of the collieries. Yet
Colonel Stevens says, in this paper: &#8220;I can see nothing to
hinder a steam-carriage moving on its ways with a velocity
of 100 miles an hour;&#8221; adding, in a foot-note: &#8220;This astonishing
velocity is considered here merely possible. It is
probable that it may not, in practise, be convenient to exceed
20 or 30 miles per hour. Actual experiment can only
determine this matter, and I should not be surprised at
seeing steam-carriages propelled at the rate of 40 or 50
miles an hour.&#8221;
</p>

<p>At a yet earlier date he had addressed a memoir to the
proper authorities, urging his plans for railroads. He
proposed rails of timber, protected, when necessary, by
iron plates, or to be made wholly of iron; the car-wheels
were to be of cast-iron, with inside flanges to keep them on
the track. The steam-engine was to be driven by steam of
50 pounds pressure and upward, and to be non-condensing.</p>

<p>Answering the objections of Robert R. Livingston and
of the State Commissioners of New York, he goes further into
details. He gives 500 to 1,000 pounds as the maximum
weight to be placed on each wheel; shows that the trains, or
&#8220;suits of carriages,&#8221; as he calls them, will make their journeys
with as much certainty and celerity in the darkest night
as in the light of day; shows that the grades of proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
roads would offer but little resistance; and places the whole
subject before the public with such accuracy of statement
and such evident appreciation of its true value, that every
one who reads this remarkable document will agree fully
with President Charles King, who said<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a
href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> that &#8220;whosoever
shall attentively read this pamphlet, will perceive that the
political, financial, commercial, and military aspects of this
great question were all present to Colonel Stevens&#8217;s mind,
and that he felt that he was fulfilling a patriotic duty when
he placed at the disposal of his native country these fruits
of his genius. The offering was not then accepted. The
&#8216;Thinker&#8217; was ahead of his age; but it is grateful to know
that he lived to see his projects carried out, though not by
the Government, and that, before he finally, in 1838, closed
his eyes in death, at the great age of eighty-nine, he could
justly feel assured that the name of Stevens, in his own
person and in that of his sons, was imperishably enrolled
among those which a grateful country will cherish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without having made any one superlatively great improvement
in the mechanism of the steam-engine, like that
which gave Watt his fame&mdash;without having the honor even
of being the first to propose the propulsion of vessels by the
modern steam-engine, or steam-transportation on land&mdash;he
exhibited a far better knowledge of the science and the art
of engineering than any man of his time; and he entertained
and urged more advanced opinions and more statesmanlike
views in relation to the economical importance of
the improvement and the application of the steam-engine,
both on land and water, than seem to be attributable to
any other leading engineer of that time.</p>

<p>Says Dr. King: &#8220;Who can estimate if, at that day, acting
upon the well-considered suggestion of President Madison,
&#8216;of the signal advantages to be derived to the United
States from a general system of internal communication and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
conveyance,&#8217; Congress had entertained Colonel Stevens&#8217;s
proposal, and, after verifying by actual experiment upon a
small scale the accuracy of his plan, had organized such a
&#8216;general system of internal communication and conveyance;&#8217;
who can begin to estimate the inappreciable benefits
that would have resulted therefrom to the comfort, the
wealth, the power, and, above all, to the absolutely impregnable
union of our great Republic and all its component
parts? All this Colonel Stevens embraced in his views,
for he was a statesman as well as an experimental philosopher;
and whoever shall attentively read his pamphlet, will
perceive that the political, financial, commercial, and military
aspects of this great question were all present to his
mind, and he felt that he was fulfilling a patriotic duty
when he placed at the disposal of his native country these
fruits of his genius.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Hedley</span>, who has already been referred to,
seems to have been the first to show, by carefully-conducted
experiment, how far the adhesion of the wheels of the locomotive-engine
could be relied upon for hauling-power in
the transportation of loads.</p>

<p>His employer, Blackett, had applied to Trevithick for a
locomotive-engine to haul coal-trains at the Wylam collieries;
but Trevithick was unable, or was disinclined, to build
him one, and in October, 1812, Hedley was authorized to
attempt the construction of an engine. It was at about
this time that Blenkinsop (1811) was trying the toothed rail
or rack, the Messrs. Chapman (December, 1812) were experimenting
with a towing-chain, and (May, 1813) Brunton
with movable legs.</p>

<p>Hedley, who had known of the success met with in the
experiments of Trevithick with smooth wheels hauling loads
of considerable weight, in Cornwall, was confident that equal
success might be expected in the north-country, and built
a carriage to be moved by men stationed at four handles,
by which its wheels were turned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>This carriage was loaded with heavy masses of iron, and
attached to trains of coal-wagons on the railway. By repeated
experiment, varying the weight of the traction-carriage
and the load hauled, Hedley ascertained the proportion
of the weight required for adhesion to that of the loads
drawn. It was thus conclusively proven that the weight of
his proposed locomotive-engine would be sufficient to give
the pulling-power necessary for the propulsion of the coal-trains
which it was to haul.</p>

<p>When the wheels slipped in consequence of the presence
of grease, frost, or moisture on the rail, Hedley proposed to
sprinkle ashes on the track, as sand is now distributed from
the sand-box of the modern engine. This was in October,
1812.</p>

<p>Hedley now went to work building an engine with
smooth wheels, and patented his design March 13, 1813, a
month after he had put his engine at work. The locomotive
had a cast-iron boiler, and a single steam-cylinder 6
inches in diameter, with a small fly-wheel. This engine
had too small a boiler, and he soon after built a larger engine,
with a return-flue boiler made of wrought-iron. This
hauled 8 loaded coal-wagons 5 miles an hour at first, and a
little later 10, doing the work of 10 horses. The steam-pressure
was carried at about 50 pounds, and the exhaust,
led into the chimney, where the pipe was turned upward,
thus secured a blast of considerable intensity in its small
chimney. Hedley also contracted the opening of the exhaust-pipe
to intensify the blast, and was subjected to some
annoyance by proprietors of lands along his railway, who
were irritated by the burning of their grass and hedges,
which were set on fire by the sparks thrown out of the
chimney of the locomotive. The cost of Hedley&#8217;s experiment
was defrayed by Mr. Blackett.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Hedley mounted his engine on eight
wheels, the four-wheeled engines having been frequently
stopped by breaking the light rails then in use. Hedley&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
engines continued in use at the Wylam collieries many
years. The second engine was removed in 1862, and is now
preserved at the South Kensington Museum, London.</p>

<p class="caption">George Stephenson.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Port9">George Stephenson</a></span>, to whom is generally accorded
the honor of having first made the locomotive-engine a success,
built his first engine at Killingworth, England, in 1814.</p>

<p>At this time Stephenson was by no means alone in the
field, for the idea of applying the steam-engine to driving
carriages on common roads and on railroads was beginning,
as has been seen, to attract considerable attention. Stephenson,
however, combined, in a very fortunate degree,
the advantages of great natural inventive talent and an
excellent mechanical training, reminding one strongly of
James Watt. Indeed, Stephenson&#8217;s portrait bears some
resemblance to <a href="#Port4">that</a> of the earlier great inventor.</p>

<p>George Stephenson was born June 9, 1781, at Wylam,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and was the son of a &#8220;north-country
miner.&#8221; When still a child, he exhibited great mechanical
talent and unusual love of study. When set at
work about the mines, his attention to duty and his intelligence
obtained for him rapid promotion, until, when but
seventeen years of age, he was made engineer, and took
charge of the pumping-engine at which his father was fireman.</p>

<p>When a mere child, and employed as a herd-boy, he
amused himself making model engines in clay, and, as he
grew older, never lost an opportunity to learn the construction
and management of machinery. After having been
employed at Newburn and Callerton, where he first became
&#8220;engine-man,&#8221; he began to study with greater interest than
ever the various steam-engines which were then in use; and
both the Newcomen engine and the Watt pumping-engine
were soon thoroughly understood by him. After having
become a brakeman, he removed to Willington Quay,
where he married, and commenced his wedded life on 18 or
20 shillings per week. It was here that he became an intimate
friend of the distinguished William Fairbairn, who
was then working as an apprentice at the Percy Main
Colliery, near by. The &#8220;father of the railroad&#8221; and the
future President of the British Association were accustomed,
at times, to &#8220;change works,&#8221; and were frequently
seen in consultation over their numerous projects. It was
at Willington Quay that his son Robert, who afterward
became a distinguished civil engineer, was born, October
16, 1803.</p>

<p>In the following year Stephenson removed to Killingworth,
and became brakeman at that colliery; but his
wife soon died, and he gladly accepted an invitation to become
engine-driver at a spinning-mill near Montrose, Scotland.
At the end of a year he returned, on foot, to Killingworth
with his savings (about &pound;28), expended over one-half
of the amount in paying his father&#8217;s debts and in making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
his parents comfortable, and then returned to his old
station as brakeman at the pit.</p>

<p>Here he made some useful improvements in the arrangement
of the machinery, and spent his spare hours in studying
his engine and planning new machines. He a little
later distinguished himself by altering and repairing an
old Newcomen engine at the High Pit, which had failed
to give satisfaction, making it thoroughly successful after
three days&#8217; work. The engine cleared the pit, at which it
had been vainly laboring a long time, in two days after
Stephenson started it up.</p>

<p>In the year 1812, Stephenson was made engine-wright of
the Killingworth High Pit, receiving &pound;100 a year, and it was
made his duty to supervise the machinery of all the collieries
under lease by the so-called &#8220;Grand Allies.&#8221; It was
here, and at this period, that he commenced a systematic
course of self-improvement and the education of his son,
and here he first began to be recognized as an inventor.
He was full of life and something of a wag, and often made
most amusing applications of his inventive powers: as when
he placed the watch, which a comrade had brought him as
out of repairs, in the oven &#8220;to cook,&#8221; his quick eye having
noted the fact that the difficulty arose simply from the
clogging of the wheels by the oil, which had been congealed
by cold.</p>

<p>Smiles,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> his biographer, describes his cottage as a perfect
curiosity-shop, filled with models of engines, machines of
various kinds, and novel apparatus. He connected the cradles
of his neighbors&#8217; wives with the smoke-jacks in their
chimneys, and thus relieved them from constant attendance
upon their infants; he fished at night with a submarine
lamp, which attracted the fish from all sides, and gave him
wonderful luck; he also found time to give colloquial instruction
to his fellow-workmen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>He built a self-acting inclined plane for his pit, on which
the wagons, descending loaded, drew up the empty trains;
and made so many improvements at the Killingworth pit,
that the number of horses employed underground was reduced
from 100 to 16.</p>

<p>Stephenson now had more liberty than when employed
at the brakes, and, hearing of the experiments of Blackett
and Hedley at Wylam, went over to their colliery to study
their engine. He also went to Leeds to see the Blenkinsop
engine draw, at a trial, 70 tons at the rate of 3 miles
an hour, and expressed his opinion in the characteristic remark,
&#8220;I think I could make a better engine than that to
go upon legs.&#8221; He very soon made the attempt.</p>

<p>Having laid the subject before the proprietors of the
lease under which the collieries were worked, and convinced
Lord Ravensworth, the principal owner, of the advantages
to be secured by the use of a &#8220;traveling engine,&#8221; that
nobleman advanced the money required. Stephenson at
once commenced his first locomotive-engine, building it in
the workshops at West Moor, assisted mainly by John
Thirlwall, the colliery blacksmith, during the years 1813
and 1814, completing it in July of the latter year.</p>

<p>This engine had a wrought-iron boiler 8 feet long and
2 feet 10 inches in diameter, with a single flue 20 inches in
diameter. The cylinders were vertical, 8 inches in diameter
and of 2 feet stroke of piston, set in the boiler, and
driving a set of wheels which geared with each other and
with other cogged wheels on the two driving-axles. A feed-water
heater surrounded the base of the chimney. This
engine drew 30 tons on a rising gradient of 10 or 12 feet to
the mile at the rate of 4 miles an hour. This engine proved
in many respects defective, and the cost of its operation
was found to be about as great as that of employing horse-power.</p>

<p>Stephenson determined to build another engine on a
somewhat different plan, and patented its design in February,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
1815. It proved a much more efficient machine than
the &#8220;Bl&uuml;cher,&#8221; the first engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig51" id="Fig51"></a>
<img src="images/illo214.png" alt="Stephenson's Locomotive of 1815" width="448" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>&mdash;Stephenson&#8217;s Locomotive of 1815. Section.</p></div>

<p>This second engine (<a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a>) was also fitted with two
vertical cylinders, <i>C c</i>, but the connecting-rods were attached
directly to the four driving-wheels, <i>W W&#8242;</i>. To permit
the necessary freedom of motion, &#8220;ball-and-socket&#8221;
joints were adopted, to unite the rods with the cross-heads,
<i>R r</i>, and with the cranks, <i>R&#8242; Y&#8242;</i>; and the two driving-axles
were connected by an endless chain, <i>T t&#8242;</i>. The cranked axle
and the outside connection of the wheels, as specified in the
patent, were not used until afterward, it having been found
impossible to get the cranked axles made. In this engine
the forced draught obtained by the impulse of the exhaust-steam
was adopted, doubling the power of the machine and
permitting the use of coke as a fuel, and making it possible
to adopt the multi-tubular boiler. Small steam-cylinders,
<i>S S S</i>, took the weight of the engine and served as springs.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that George Stephenson and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Sir Humphry Davy, independently and almost simultaneously,
invented the &#8220;safety-lamp,&#8221; without which few mines
of bituminous coal could to-day be worked. The former
used small tubes, the latter fine wire gauze, to intercept the
flame. Stephenson proved the efficiency of his lamp by
going with it directly into the inflammable atmosphere of a
dangerous mine, and repeatedly permitting the light to be
extinguished when the lamp became surcharged with the
explosive mixture which had so frequently proved fatal to
the miners. This was in October and November, 1815, and
Stephenson&#8217;s work antedates that of the great philosopher.<a name="FNanchor_52_52"
id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The controversy which arose between the supporters of the
rival claims of the two inventors was very earnest, and
sometimes bitter. The friends of the young engineer raised
a subscription, amounting to above &pound;1,000, and presented it
to him as a token of their appreciation of the value of his
simple yet important contrivance. Of the two forms of
lamp, that of Stephenson is claimed to be safest, the Davy
lamp being liable to produce explosions by igniting the explosive
gas when, by its combustion within the gauze cylinder,
the latter is made red-hot. Under similar conditions,
the Stephenson lamp is simply extinguished, as was seen at
Barnsley, in 1857, at the Oaks Colliery, where both kinds
of lamp were in use, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Stephenson continued to study and experiment, with a
view to the improvement of his locomotive and the railroad.
He introduced better methods of track-laying and of
jointing the rails, adopting a half-lap, or peculiar scarf-joint,
in place of the then usual square-butt joint. He patented,
with these modifications of the permanent way, several
of his improvements of the engine. He had substituted
forged for the rude cast wheels previously used,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a
href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
made many minor changes of detail. The engines built
at this time (1816) continued in use many years. Two
years later, with a dynamometer which he designed for the
purpose, he made experimental determinations of the resistance
of trains, and showed that it was made up of several
kinds, as the sliding friction of the axle-journals in their
bearings, the rolling friction of the wheels on the rails, the
resistance due to gravity on gradients, and that due to the
resistance of the air.</p>

<p>These experiments seemed to him conclusive against the
possibility of the competition of engines on the common
highway with locomotives hauling trains on the rail. Finding
that the resistance, with his rolling-stock, and at all the
speeds at which he made his experiments, was approximately
invariable, and equivalent to about 10 pounds per ton,
and estimating that a gradient rising but 1 foot in 100
would decrease the hauling power of the engine 50 per
cent., he saw at once the necessity of making all railroads
as nearly absolutely level as possible, and, consequently, the
radically distinctive character of this branch of civil engineering
work. He persistently condemned the &#8220;folly&#8221; of
attempting the general introduction of steam on the common
road, where great changes of level and an impressible
road-bed were certain to prove fatal to success, and was
most strenuous in his advocacy of the policy of securing
level tracks, even at very great expense.</p>

<p>Taking part in the contest, which now became a serious
one, between the advocates of steam on the common road
and those urging the introduction of locomotives and their
trains on an iron track, he calculated that a road-engine
capable of carrying 20 or 30 passengers at 10 miles per hour,
could, on the rail, carry ten times as many people at three
or four times that speed. The railway-engine finally superseded
its predecessor&mdash;the engine of the common road&mdash;almost
completely.</p>

<p>In 1817, Stephenson built an engine for the Duke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Portland, to haul coal from Kilmarnock to Troon, which
cost &pound;750, and, with some interruptions, this engine worked
on that line until 1848, when it was broken up. On November
18, 1822, the Hetton Railway, near Sunderland, was
opened. George Stephenson was the engineer of the line&mdash;a
short track, 8 miles long, built from the Hetton Colliery to
the docks on the bank of the river Wear. On this line he
put in five of the &#8220;self-acting inclines&#8221;&mdash;two inclines worked
by stationary engines, the gradients being too heavy for
locomotives&mdash;and used five locomotive-engines of his own
design, which were called by the people of the neighborhood,
possibly for the first time, &#8220;the iron horses.&#8221; These
engines were quite similar to the Killingworth engine.
They drew a train of 17 coal-cars&mdash;a total load of 64 tons&mdash;about
4 miles an hour. Meantime, also, in 1823, Stephenson
had been made engineer of the Stockton &amp; Darlington
Railroad, which had been projected for the purpose
of securing transportation to tide-water for the valuable
coal-lands of Durham. This road was built without an expectation
on the part of any of its promoters, Stephenson
excepted, that steam would be used as a motor to the exclusion
of horses.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Pearse, however, one of the largest holders
of stock in the road, and one of its most earnest advocates,
became so convinced, by an examination of the Killingworth
engines and their work, of the immense advantage to
be derived by their use, that he not only supported Stephenson&#8217;s
arguments, but, with Thomas Richardson, advanced
&pound;1,000 for the purpose of assisting Stephenson to
commence the business of locomotive-engine construction at
Newcastle. This workshop, which subsequently became a
great and famous establishment, was commenced in 1824.</p>

<p>For this road Stephenson recommended wrought-iron
rails, which were then costing &pound;12 per ton&mdash;double the price
of cast rails. The directors, however, stipulated that he
should only buy one-half the rails required from the dealers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in &#8220;malleable&#8221; iron. These rails weighed 20 pounds to the
yard. After long hesitation, in the face of a serious opposition,
the directors finally concluded to order three locomotives
of Stephenson. The first, or &#8220;No. 1,&#8221; engine (<a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>)
was delivered in time for the opening of the road, September
27, 1825. It weighed 8 tons. Its boiler contained a single
straight flue, one end of which was the furnace. The
cylinders were vertical, like those of the earlier engines, and
coupled directly to the driving-wheels. The crank-pins
were set in the wheels at right angles, in order that, while
one engine was &#8220;turning the centre,&#8221; the other might exert
its maximum power. The two pairs of drivers were coupled
by horizontal rods, as seen in the figure, which represents
this engine as subsequently mounted on a pedestal at the Darlington
station. A steam-blast in the chimney gave the
requisite strength of draught. These engines were built for
slow and heavy work, but were capable of making what was
then thought the satisfactorily high speed of 16 miles per
hour. The inclines on the road were worked by fixed engines.</p>

<p>On the <a href="#Fig53">opening day</a>, which was celebrated as a holiday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
by the people far and near, the No. 1 engine drew 90 tons
at the rate of 12, and at times 15, miles an hour.</p>

<p>Stephenson&#8217;s engines were kept at work hauling coal-trains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
but the passenger-coaches were all drawn for some
time by horses, and the latter system was a rude forerunner,
in most respects, of modern street-railway transportation.
Mixed passenger and freight trains were next introduced,
and, soon after, separate passenger-trains drawn by faster
engines were placed on the line, and the present system of
railroad transportation was now fairly inaugurated.</p>

<p>A railroad between Manchester and Liverpool had been
projected at about the time that the Stockton &amp; Darlington
road was commenced. The preliminary surveys had
been made in the face of strong opposition, which did not
always stop at legal action and verbal attack, but in
some instances led to the display of force. The surveyors
were sometimes driven from their work by a mob armed
with sticks and stones, urged on by land-proprietors and
those interested in the lines of coaches on the highway.
Before the opening of the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railroad,
the Liverpool &amp; Manchester bill had been carried
through Parliament, after a very determined effort on the
part of coach-proprietors and landholders to defeat it, and
Stephenson urged the adoption of the locomotive to the
exclusion of horses. It was his assertion, made at this
time, that he could build a locomotive to run 20 miles an
hour, that provoked the celebrated rejoinder of a writer in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, who was, however, in favor of the
construction of the road and of the use of the locomotive
upon it: &#8220;What can be more palpably absurd and ridiculous,
than the prospect held out of locomotives traveling
<i>twice as fast</i> as stage-coaches? We would as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off
upon one of Congreve&#8217;s ricochet-rockets, as trust themselves
to the mercy of such a machine going at such a rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was during his examination before a committee of
the House of Commons, during this contest, that Stephenson,
when asked, &#8220;Suppose, now, one of your engines to
be going at the rate of 9 or 10 miles an hour, and that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cow were to stray upon the line and get in the way of the
engine, would not that be a very awkward circumstance?&#8221;
replied, &#8220;Yes, <i>very</i> awkward&mdash;<i>for the coo!</i>&#8221; And when
asked if men and animals would not be frightened by the
red-hot smoke-pipe, answered, &#8220;But how would they know
that it was not <i>painted?</i>&#8221; The line was finally built, with
George Rennie as consulting, and Stephenson as principal
constructing engineer.</p>

<p>His work on this road became one of the important
elements of the success, and one of the great causes
of the distinction, which marked the life of these rising
engineers. The successful construction of that part of
the line which lay across &#8220;Chat Moss,&#8221; an unfathomable
swampy deposit of peat, extending over an area of 12
square miles, and the building of which had been repeatedly
declared an impossibility, was in itself sufficient to
prove that the engineer who had accomplished it was no
common man. Stephenson adopted the very simple yet
bold expedient of using, as a filling, compacted turf and peat,
and building a road-bed of materials lighter than water,
or the substance composing the bog, and thus forming a
<i>floating</i> embankment, on which he laid his rails. To the
surprise of every one but Stephenson himself, the plan
proved perfectly successful, and even surprisingly economical,
costing but little more than one-tenth the estimate of
at least one engineer. Among the other great works on
this remarkable pioneer-line were the tunnel, a mile and a
half long, from the station at Liverpool to Edgehill; the
Olive Mount deep-cut, two miles long, and in some places
100 feet deep, through red sandstone, of which nearly
500,000 yards were removed; the Sankey Viaduct, a brick
structure of nine arches, of 50 feet span each, costing
&pound;45,000; and a number of other pieces of work which are
noteworthy in even these days of great works.</p>

<p>Stephenson planned all details of the line, and even designed
the bridges, machinery, engines, turn-tables, switches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and crossings, and was responsible for every part of the
work of their construction.</p>

<p>Finally, the work of building the line approached completion,
and it became necessary promptly to settle the long-deferred
question of a method of applying motive-power.
Some of the directors and their advisers still advocated the
use of horses; many thought stationary hauling-engines
preferable; and the remainder were, almost to a man, undecided.
The locomotive had no outspoken advocate, and
few had the slightest faith in it. George Stephenson was
almost alone, and the opponents of steam had secured a
provision in the Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railroad concession,
stipulating expressly that horses should there be exclusively
employed. The directors did, however, in 1828, permit
Stephenson to put on the line a locomotive, to be used, during
its construction, in hauling gravel-trains. A committee
was sent, at Stephenson&#8217;s request, to see the Stockton &amp;
Darlington engines, but no decided expression of opinion
seems to have been made by them. Two well-known professional
engineers reported in favor of fixed engines, and
advised the division of the line into 19 stages of about a
mile and a half each, and the use of 21 fixed engines, although
they admitted the excessive first-cost of that system.
The board was naturally strongly inclined to adopt their
plan. Stephenson, however, earnestly and persistently opposed
such action, and, after long debate, it was finally determined
&#8220;to give the traveling engine a chance.&#8221; The
board decided to offer a reward of &pound;500 for the best locomotive-engine,
and prescribed the following conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The engine must consume its own smoke.</p>

<p>2. The engine, if of 6 tons weight, must be able to draw after it, day
by day, 20 tons weight (including the tender and water-tank) at 10 miles an
hour, with a pressure of steam on the boiler not exceeding 50 pounds to the
square inch.</p>

<p>3. The boiler must have two safety-valves, neither of which must be fastened
down, and one of them completely out of the control of the engine-man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 1em;"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>4.
The engine and boiler must be supported on springs, and rest on 6
wheels, the height of the whole not exceeding 15 feet to the top of the
chimney.</p>

<p>5. The engine, with water, must not weigh more than 6 tons; but an
engine of less weight would be preferred, on its drawing a proportionate
load behind it; if of only 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons, then it might be put only on 4 wheels.
The company to be at liberty to test the boiler, etc., by a pressure of 150
pounds to the square inch.</p>

<p>6. A mercurial gauge must be affixed to the machine, showing the
steam-pressure above 45 pounds to the square inch.</p>

<p>7. The engine must be delivered, complete and ready for trial, at the
Liverpool end of the railway, not later than the 1st of October, 1829.</p>

<p>8. The price of the engine must not exceed &pound;550.</p></div>

<p>This circular was printed and published throughout the
kingdom, and a considerable number of engines were constructed
to compete at the trial, which was proposed to
take place October 1, 1829, but which was deferred to the
6th of that month. Only four engines, however, were finally
entered on the day of the trial. These were the &#8220;Novelty,&#8221;
constructed by Messrs. Braithwaite &amp; Ericsson, the
latter being the distinguished engineer who subsequently
came to the United States to introduce screw-propulsion,
and, later, the monitor system of iron-clads; the &#8220;Rocket,&#8221;
built from Stephenson&#8217;s plans; and the &#8220;Sanspareil&#8221; and
the &#8220;Perseverance,&#8221; built by Hackworth and Burstall, respectively.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Sanspareil,&#8221; which was built under the direction
of Timothy Hackworth, one of Stephenson&#8217;s earlier foremen,
resembled the engine built by the latter for the Stockton
&amp; Darlington road, but was heavier than had been stipulated,
was not ready for work when called, and, when finally
set at work, proved to be very extravagant in its use of
fuel, partly in consequence of the extreme intensity of its
blast, which caused the expulsion of unconsumed coals from
the furnace.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Perseverance&#8221; could not attain the specified speed,
and was withdrawn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The &#8220;Novelty&#8221; was apparently a well-designed and for
that time a remarkably well-proportioned machine. <i>A</i>, in
<a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>, is the boiler, <i>D</i> the steam-cylinders, <i>E</i> a heater.
Its weight but slightly exceeded three tons, and it was a
&#8220;tank engine,&#8221; carrying its own fuel and water at <i>B</i>. A
forced draught was obtained by means of the bellows, <i>C</i>.
This engine was run over the line at the rate of about 28
miles an hour at times, but its blowing apparatus failed,
and the &#8220;Rocket&#8221; held the track alone. A later trial still
left the &#8220;Rocket&#8221; alone in the field.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig55" id="Fig55"></a>
<img src="images/illo225.png" alt="The 'Rocket'" width="350" height="283" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;Rocket,&#8221; 1829.</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;Rocket&#8221; (<a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>) was built at the works of Robert
Stephenson &amp; Co., at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The boiler was
given considerable heating-surface by the introduction of
25 3-inch copper tubes, at the suggestion of Henry Booth,
secretary of the railroad company. The blast was altered
by gradually closing in the opening at the extremity of the
exhaust-pipe, and thus &#8220;sharpening&#8221; it until it was found
to have the requisite intensity. The effect of this modification
of the shape of the pipe was observed carefully by
means of syphon water-gauges attached to the chimney.
The draft was finally given such an intensity as to raise the
water 3 inches in the tube of the draught-gauge. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
total length of the boiler was 6 feet, its diameter 40 inches.
The fire-box was attached to the rear of the boiler, and was
3 feet high and 2 feet wide, with water-legs to protect its
side-sheets from injury by overheating. The cylinders, as
seen in the sketch, were inclined, and coupled to a single
pair of driving-wheels. A tender, attached to the engine,
carried the fuel and water. The engine weighed less than
4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons.</p>

<p>The little engine does not seem to have been very prepossessing
in appearance, and the &#8220;Novelty&#8221; is said to have
been the general favorite, the Stephenson engine having
few, if any, backers among the spectators. On its first
trial, it ran 12 miles in less than an hour.</p>

<p>After the accident which disabled the &#8220;Novelty,&#8221; the
&#8220;Rocket&#8221; came forward again, and ran at the rate of from
25 to 30 miles an hour, drawing a single carriage carrying 30
passengers. Two days later, on the 8th of October, steam
was raised in a little less than an hour from cold water, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
it then, with 13 tons of freight in the train, ran 35 miles in
1 hour and 48 minutes, including stops, and attained a speed
of 29 miles an hour. The average of all runs for the trial
was 15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>This success, far exceeding the expectation of the most
sanguine of the advocates of the system, and greatly exceeding
what had been asserted by opponents to be the
bounds of possibility, settled completely the whole question,
and the Manchester &amp; Liverpool road was at once
equipped with locomotive engines.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Rocket&#8221; remained on the line until 1837, when it
was sold, and set at work by the purchasers on the Midgeholme
Railway, near Carlisle. On one occasion, on this
road, it was driven 4 miles in 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> minutes. It is now in the
Patent Museum at South Kensington, London.</p>

<p>In January, 1830, a single line of rails had been carried
across Chat Moss, and, six months later, the first train,
drawn by the &#8220;Arrow,&#8221; ran through, June 14th, from Liverpool
to Manchester, making the trip in an hour and a
half, and attaining a maximum speed of over 27 miles an
hour. The line was formally opened to traffic September
15, 1830.</p>

<p>This was one of the most notable occasions in the history
of the railroad, and the successful termination of the
great work was celebrated, as so important an event should
be, by impressive ceremonies. Among the distinguished
spectators were Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington.
Mr. Huskisson, a Member of Parliament for Liverpool,
was also present. There had been built for the line, by Robert
Stephenson &amp; Co., 7 locomotives besides the &#8220;Rocket,&#8221;
and a large number of carriages. These were all brought
out in procession, and 600 passengers entered the train,
which started for Manchester, and ran at times, on smooth
portions of the road, at the rate of 20 and 25 miles an hour.
Crowds of people along the line cheered at this strange
and to them incomprehensible spectacle, and the story of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the wonderful performances of that day on the new railroad
was repeated in every corner of the land. A sad accident,
the precursor of thousands to follow the introduction of the
new method of transportation, while it repressed the rising
enthusiasm of the people and dampened the ardor of the
most earnest of the advocates of the railroad, occurring
during this trip, assisted in making known the power of the
new motor and the danger attending its use as well. The
trains stopped for water at Parkside, and occasion was
taken to send the &#8220;Northumbrian,&#8221; an engine driven by
George Stephenson himself, on a side track, with the carriage
containing the Duke of Wellington, and the other
engines and trains were all directed to be sent along the
main track in view of the Duke and his party. While this
movement was in process of execution, Mr. Huskisson, who
had carelessly stood on the main line until the &#8220;Rocket,&#8221;
which led the column, had nearly reached him, attempted
to enter the carriage of the Duke. He was too late, and
was struck by the &#8220;Rocket,&#8221; thrown down across the rail,
and the advancing engine crushed a leg so seriously that he
died the same evening. Immediately after the accident, he
was placed on the &#8220;Northumbrian,&#8221; and Stephenson made
the 15 miles to the destination of the wounded man in 25
minutes&mdash;a speed of 36 miles an hour. The news of this accident,
and the statement of the velocity of the engine, were
published throughout the kingdom and Europe; and the
misfortune of this first victim of a railroad accident was one
of the causes of the immediate adoption and rapid spread
of the modern railway system.</p>

<p>This road, which was built in the hope of securing 400
passengers per day, almost immediately averaged 1,200, and
in five years reported 500,000 passengers for the year.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a
href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The
success of this road insured the general introduction of
railroads, and from this time forward there was never a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
doubt of their ultimate adoption to the exclusion of every
other system of general internal communication and transportation.</p>

<p>For some years after this his first great triumph, George
Stephenson gave his whole time to the building of railroads
and the improvement of the engine. He was assisted by
his son Robert, to whom he gradually surrendered his business,
and retired to Tapton House, on the Midland Railway,
and led a busy but pleasant life during the remaining years
of his existence.</p>

<p>Even as early as 1840, he seems to have projected many
improvements which were only generally adopted many
years later. He proposed self-acting and continuous systems
of brake, and considered a good system of brake of so
great importance, that he advocated their compulsory introduction
by State legislation. He advised moderate speeds,
from considerations both of safety and of expense.</p>

<p>A few years after the opening of the Liverpool &amp;
Manchester road, great numbers of schemes were proposed
by ignorant or designing men, which had for their object
the filling of the pockets of their proposers rather than the
benefit of the stockholders and the public; and the Stephensons
were often called upon to combat these crude and
ill-digested plans. Among these was the pneumatic system
of propulsion, already referred to as first proposed by Papin,
in combination with his double-acting air-pump, in 1687.
It had been again proposed in the early part of the present
century by Medhurst, who proposed a method of pneumatic
transmission of small parcels and of letters, which is now
in use, and, 15 years later, a railroad to take the place of
that of Stephenson and his coadjutors. The most successful
of several attempts to introduce this method was that
of Clegg &amp; Samuda, at West London, and on the London
&amp; Croydon road, and again in Ireland, between Kingstown
and Dalkey. A line of pipe, <i>B B</i>, seen in <a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>,
two feet in diameter, was laid between the rails, <i>A A</i>, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the road. This pipe was fitted with a nicely-packed piston,
carrying a strong arm, which rose through a slit made along
the top of the pipe, and covered by a flexible strip of
leather, <i>E E</i>. This arm was attached to the carriage, <i>C C</i>,
to be propelled. The pressure of the atmosphere being removed,
by the action of a powerful pump, from the side
toward which the train was to advance, the pressure of the
atmosphere on the opposite side drove the piston forward,
carrying the train with it. Stephenson was convinced,
after examining the plans of the projectors, that the scheme
would fail, and so expressed himself. Those who favored
it, however, had sufficient influence with capitalists to secure
repeated trials, although each was followed by failure, and
it was several years before the last was heard of this system.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of several of the later years of
Stephenson&#8217;s life was spent in traveling in Europe, partly
on business and partly for pleasure. During a visit to Belgium
in 1845, he was received everywhere, and by all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
classes, from the king down to the humblest of his subjects,
with such distinction as is rarely accorded even to the
greatest men. He soon after visited Spain with Sir Joshua
Walmsley, to report on a proposed railway from the capital
to the Bay of Biscay. On this journey he was taken ill,
and his health was permanently impaired. Thenceforward
he devoted himself principally to the direction of his own
property, which had become very considerable, and spent
much of his time at the collieries and other works in which
he had invested it. His son had now entirely relieved him
of all business connected with railroads, and he had leisure
to devote to self-improvement and social amusement. Among
his friends he claimed Sir Robert Peel, his old acquaintance,
now Sir William, Fairbairn, Dr. Buckland, and many others
of the distinguished men of that time.</p>

<p>In August, 1848, Stephenson was attacked with intermittent
fever, succeeded by h&aelig;morrhage from the lungs, and
died on the 12th of that month, at the age of sixty-six
years, honored of all men, and secure of an undying fame.
Soon after his death, statues were erected at Liverpool,
London, and Newcastle, the cost of the second of which
was defrayed by private subscriptions, including a contribution
of about $1,500 by 3,150 workingmen&mdash;one of the
finest tributes ever offered to the memory of a great man.</p>

<p>But the noblest monument is that which he himself
erected by the establishment of a system of education and
protection of his working-people at Clay Cross. He made it
a condition of employment that every employ&eacute; should contribute
from five to twelve pence each fortnight to a fund,
to which the works also made liberal contributions. From
that fund it was directed that the expenses of free education
of the children of the work-people, night-schools for those
employed in the works, a reading-room and library, medical
treatment, and a benevolent fund were to be defrayed.
Music and cricket-clubs, and prize funds for the best garden,
were also founded. The school, public hall, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
church of Clay Cross, and this noble system of support, are
together a nobler monument than any statue or similar
structure could be.</p>

<p>The character of George Stephenson was in every way
admirable. Simple, earnest, and honorable; courageous,
indomitable, and industrious; humorous, kind, and philanthropic,
his memory will long be cherished, and will long
prove an incentive to earnest effort and to the pursuit of an
honorable fame with hundreds of the youth who, reading
his simple yet absorbing story, as told by his biographer,
shall in later years learn to know him.</p>

<p>After the death of his father, Robert Stephenson continued,
as he had already done for several years, to conduct
the business of building locomotives, as well as of constructing
railroads. The work of locomotive engine-building was
done at Newcastle, and for many years those works were
the principal engine-building establishment of the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>After their introduction on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester
road, the engines of the firm of Robert Stephenson &amp;
Co. were rapidly modified, until they assumed the form
shown in <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>, which remained standard until their
gradual increase in weight compelled the builders to place
a larger number of wheels beneath them, and make those
other changes which finally resulted in the creation of distinct
types for special kinds of work. In the engine of
1833, as shown above, the cylinders, <i>A</i>, are carried at the
extreme forward end of the boiler, and the driving-wheels,
<i>B</i>, are coupled directly to the connecting-rod of the engine
and to each other. A buffer, <i>C</i>, extends in front, and the
rear end of the boiler is formed into a rectangular fire-box,
<i>D</i>, continuous with the shell, <i>E</i>, and the flame and gases
pass to the connection and smoke-pipe, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, through a
large number of small tubes, <i>a</i>. Steam is led to the cylinders
by a steam-pipe, <i>H H</i>, to which it is admitted by the
throttle-valve, <i>b</i>. A steam-dome, <i>I</i>, from which the steam
is taken, assists by giving more steam-space far above the
water-line, and thus furnishing dry steam. The exhaust
steam issues with great velocity into the chimney from the
pipe, <i>J</i>, giving great intensity of draught. The engine-driver
stands on the platform, <i>K</i>, from which all the valves
and handles are accessible. Feed-pumps, <i>L</i>, supply the
boiler with water, which is drawn from the tender through
the pipes, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>&mdash;The Stephenson Valve-Gear, 1833.</p></div>

<p>The valve-gear was then substantially what it is to-day,
the &#8220;Stephenson link&#8221; (<a href="#Fig58">Fig. 58</a>). On the driving-axle were
keyed two eccentrics, <i>E</i>, so set that the motion of the one
was adapted to driving the valve when the engine was moving
forward, and the other was arranged to move the valve
when running backward. The former was connected,
through its strap and the rod, <i>B</i>, to the upper end of a
&#8220;strap-link,&#8221; <i>A</i>, while the second was similarly connected
with the lower end. By means of a handle, <i>L</i>, and the link,
<i>n</i>, and its connections, including the counterweighted
bell-crank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<i>M</i>, this link could be raised or depressed, thus
bringing the pin on the link-block, to which the valve-stem
was connected, into action with either eccentric. Or,
the link being set in mid-gear, the valve would cover both
steam-ports of the cylinder, and the engine could move
neither way. As shown, the engine is in position to run
backward. A series of notches, <i>Z</i>, into either of which a
catch on <i>L</i> could be dropped, enabled the driver to place
the link where he chose. In intermediate positions, between
mid-gear and full-gear, the motion of the valve is
such as to produce expansion of the steam, and some gain
in economy of working, although reducing the power of the
engine.</p>

<p>The success of the railroad and the locomotive in Great
Britain led to its rapid introduction in other countries. In
France, as early as 1823, M. Beaunier was authorized to
construct a line of rails from the coal-mines of St. &Eacute;tienne
to the Loire, using horses for the traction of his trains; and
in 1826, MM. Seguin began a road from St. &Eacute;tienne to
Lyons. In 1832, engines built at Lyons were substituted
for horses on these roads, but internal agitations interrupted
the progress of the new system in France, and, for 10 years
after the opening of the Manchester &amp; Liverpool road,
France remained without steam-transportation on land.</p>

<p>In Belgium the introduction of the locomotive was more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
promptly accomplished. Under the direction of Pierre
Simon, an enterprising and well-informed young engineer,
who had become known principally as an advocate of the
even then familiar project of a canal across the Isthmus of
Darien, very complete plans of railroad communication for
the kingdom were prepared, in compliance with a decree
dated July 31, 1834, and were promptly authorized. The
road between Brussels and Mechlin was opened May 6,
1837, and other roads were soon built; and the railway system
of Belgium was the first on the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>The first German railroad worked with locomotive steam-engines
was that between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, built under
the direction of M. Denis. The other European countries
soon followed in this rapid march of improvement.</p>

<p>In the United States, public attention had been directed
to this subject, as has already been stated, very early in the
present century, by Evans and Stevens. At that time the
people of the United States, as was natural, closely watched
every important series of events in the mother-country;
and so remarkable and striking a change as that which was
taking place in the time of Stephenson, in methods of communication
and transportation, could not fail to attract
general attention and awaken universal interest.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the success of the early experiments of
Evans and others, and in spite of the statesmanlike arguments
of Stevens and Dearborn, and the earnest advocacy
of the plan by all who were familiar with the revelations
which were daily made of the power and capabilities of the
steam-engine, it was not until after the opening of the Manchester
&amp; Liverpool road that any action was taken looking
to the introduction of the locomotive. Colonel John
Stevens, in 1825, had built a small locomotive, which he
had placed on a circular railway before his house&mdash;now
Hudson Terrace&mdash;at Hoboken, to prove that his statements
had a basis of fact. This engine had two &#8220;lantern&#8221; tubular
boilers, each composed of small iron tubes, arranged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
vertically in circles about the furnaces.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a
href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This exhibition
had no other effect, however, than to create some interest
in the subject, which aided in securing a rapid adoption of
the railroad when once introduced.</p>

<p>The first line of rails in the New England States is
said to have been laid down at Quincy, Mass., from the
granite quarry to the Neponset River, three miles away, in
1826 and 1827. That between the coal-mines of Mauch
Chunk, Pa., and the river Lehigh, nine miles distant, was
built in 1827. In the following year the Delaware &amp;
Hudson Canal Company built a railroad from their mines
to the termination of the canal at Honesdale. These roads
were worked either by gravity or by horses and mules.</p>

<p>The competition at Rainhill, on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railroad, had been so widely advertised, and promised
to afford such conclusive evidence relative to the value
of the locomotive steam-engine and the railroad, that engineers
and others interested in the subject came from all
parts of the world to witness the trial. Among the strangers
present were Mr. Horatio Allen, then chief-engineer of
the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, and Mr. E. L.
Miller, a resident of Charleston, S. C., who went from the
United States for the express purpose of seeing the new
machines tested.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen had been authorized to purchase, for the company
with which he was connected, three locomotives and
the iron for the road, and had already shipped one engine
to the United States, and had set it at work on the road.
This engine was received in New York in May, 1829, and
its trial took place in August at Honesdale, Mr. Allen himself
driving the engine. But the track proved too light for
the locomotive, and it was laid up and never set at regular
work. This engine was called the &#8220;Stourbridge Lion&#8221;; it
was built by Foster, Rastrick &amp; Co., of Stourbridge, England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
During the summer of the next year, a small experimental
engine, which was built in 1829 by Peter Cooper,
of New York, was successfully tried on the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio Railroad, at Baltimore, making 13 miles in less than
an hour, and moving, at some points on the road, at the rate
of 18 miles an hour. One carriage carrying 36 passengers
was attached. This was considered a working-model only,
and was rated at one horse-power.</p>

<p>Ross Winans, writing of this trial of Cooper&#8217;s engine,
makes a comparison with the work done by Stephenson&#8217;s
&#8220;Rocket,&#8221; and claims a decided superiority for the former.
He concluded that the trial established fully the practicability
of using locomotives on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio road
at high speeds, and on all its curves and heavy gradients,
without inconvenience or danger.</p>

<p>This engine had a vertical tubular boiler, and the draught
was urged, like that of the &#8220;Novelty&#8221; at Liverpool, by mechanical
means&mdash;a revolving fan. The single steam-cylinder
was 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>
inches in diameter, and the stroke of piston 14<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
inches. The wheels were 30 inches in diameter, and connected
to the crank-shaft by gearing. The engine, on the
trial, worked up to 1.43 horse-power, and drew a gross
weight of 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons. Mr. Cooper, unable to find such tubes
as he needed for his boiler, used gun-barrels. The whole
machine weighed less than a ton.</p>

<p>Messrs. Davis &amp; Gartner, a little later, built the &#8220;York&#8221;
for this road&mdash;a locomotive having also a vertical boiler, of
very similar form to the modern steam fire-engine boiler, 51
inches in diameter, and containing 282 fire-tubes, 16 inches
long, and tapering from 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches diameter at the bottom
to 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> at the top, where the gases were discharged through
a combustion-chamber into a steam-chimney. This engine
weighed 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig59" id="Fig59"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;Atlantic,&#8221; 1882.</p></div>

<p>They subsequently built several &#8220;grasshopper&#8221; engines
(<a href="#Fig59">Fig. 59</a>), some of which ran many years, doing good work,
and one or two of which are still in existence. The first&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
&#8220;Atlantic&#8221;&mdash;was set at work in September, 1832, and
hauled 50 tons from Baltimore 40 miles, over gradients having
a maximum rise of 37 feet to the mile, and on curves
having a minimum radius of 400 feet, at the rate of 12 to
15 miles an hour. This engine weighed 6<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons, carried 50
pounds of steam&mdash;a pressure then common on both continents
&mdash;and burned a ton of anthracite coal on the round trip.
The blast was secured by a fan, and the valve-gear was
worked by cams instead of eccentrics. This engine made
the round trip at a cost of $16, doing the work of 42 horses,
which had cost $33 per trip. The engine cost $4,500, and
was designed by Phineas Davis, assisted by Ross Winans.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller, on his return from the Liverpool &amp; Manchester
trial, ordered a locomotive for the Charleston &amp;
Hamburg Railroad from the West Point Foundery. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
engine was guaranteed by Mr. Miller to draw three times
its weight at the rate of 10 miles an hour. It was built
during the summer of 1830, from the plans of Mr. Miller,
and reached Charleston in October. The trials were made
in November and December.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig60" id="Fig60"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;Best Friend,&#8221; 1830.</p></div>

<p>This engine (<a href="#Fig60">Fig. 60</a>) had a vertical tubular boiler, in
which the gases rose through a very high fire-box, into
which large numbers of rods projected from the sides and
top, and passed out through tubes leading them laterally
outward into an outside jacket, through which they rose to
the chimney. The steam-cylinders were two in number,
8 inches in diameter and of 16 inches stroke, inclined so as
to connect with the driving-axle. The four wheels were all
of the same size, 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter, and connected by
coupling-rods. The engine weighed 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons. The &#8220;Best
Friend,&#8221; as it was called, did excellent work until June,
1831, when the explosion of the boiler, in consequence of the
recklessness of the fireman, unexpectedly closed its career.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>A second
engine (<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>) was built for this road, at the
West Point Foundery, from plans furnished by Horatio
Allen, and was received and set at work early in the spring
of 1831. The engine, called the &#8220;West Point,&#8221; had a horizontal
tubular boiler, but was in other respects very similar
to the &#8220;Best Friend.&#8221; It is said to have done very good
work.</p>

<p>The Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad ordered an engine
at about this time, also, of the West Point Foundery, and
the trials, made in July and August, 1831, proved thoroughly
successful.</p>

<p>This engine, the &#8220;De Witt Clinton,&#8221; was contracted for
by John B. Jervis, and fitted up by David Matthew. It
had two steam-cylinders, each 5<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter and 16
inches stroke of piston. The connecting-rods were directly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
attached to a cranked axle, and turned four coupled wheels
4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter. These wheels had cast-iron hubs and
wrought-iron spokes and tires. The tubes were of copper,
2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter and 6 feet long. The engine weighed
3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons, and hauled 5 cars at the rate of 30 miles an hour.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;South Carolina,&#8221; 1831.</p></div>

<p>Another engine, the &#8220;South Carolina&#8221; (<a href="#Fig62">Fig. 62</a>), was
designed by Horatio Allen for the South Carolina Railroad,
and completed late in the year 1831. This was the first
eight-wheeled engine, and the prototype, also, of a peculiar
and lately-revived form of engine.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1832, an engine built by Messrs. Davis
&amp; Gartner, of York, Pa., was put on the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio road, which at times attained a speed, unloaded, of 30
miles an hour. The engine weighed 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons, and drew,
usually, 4 cars, weighing altogether 14 tons, from Baltimore
to Ellicott&#8217;s Mills, a distance of 13 miles, in the schedule-time,
one hour.</p>

<p>Horatio Allen&#8217;s engine on the South Carolina Railroad
is said to have been the first eight-wheeled engine ever built.</p>

<p>It was at about the time of which we are now writing
that the first locomotive was built of what is now distinctively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
known as the American type&mdash;an engine with a
&#8220;truck&#8221; or &#8220;bogie&#8221; under the forward end of the boiler.
This was the &#8220;American&#8221; No. 1, built at the West Point
Foundery, from plans furnished by John B. Jervis, Chief
Engineer, for the Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad. Ross
Winans had already (1831) introduced the passenger-car
with swiveling trucks.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It was completed in August, 1832,
and is said by Mr. Matthew to have been an extremely fast
and smooth-running engine. A mile a minute was repeatedly
attained, and it is stated by the same authority,<a name="FNanchor_57_57"
id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> that
a speed of 80 miles an hour was sometimes made over a
single mile. This engine had cylinders 9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches diameter,
16 inches stroke of piston, two pairs of driving-wheels,
coupled, 5 feet in diameter each; and the truck had four
33-inch wheels. The boiler contained tubes 3 inches in diameter,
and its fire-box was 5 feet long and 2 feet 10 inches
wide. Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. subsequently built a similar
engine, from the plans of Mr. Jervis, and for the same
road. It was set at work in 1833. In both engines the
driving-wheels were behind the fire-box. This engine is
another illustration of the fact&mdash;shown by the description
already given of other and earlier engines&mdash;that the independence
of the American mechanic, and the boldness and
self-confidence which have to the present time distinguished
him, were among the earliest of the fruits of our political
independence and freedom.</p>

<p>These American engines were all designed to burn anthracite
coal. The English locomotives all burned bituminous
coal.</p>

<p>Robert L. Stevens, the President and Engineer of the
Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad, and a distinguished son of
Colonel John Stevens, of Hoboken, was engaged, at the
time of the opening of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railroad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in the construction of the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad.
It was here that the first of the now standard form
of <i>T</i>-rail was laid down. It was of malleable iron, and of
the form shown in the accompanying figure. It was designed
by Mr. Stevens, and is known in the United States
as the &#8220;Stevens&#8221; rail. In Europe, where it was introduced
some years afterward, it is sometimes called the &#8220;Vignolles&#8221;
rail. He purchased an engine of the Stephensons soon after
the trial at Rainhill, and this engine, the &#8220;John Bull,&#8221; was
set up on the then uncompleted road at Bordentown, in the
year 1831. Its first public trial was made in November of
that year. The road was opened for traffic, from end to
end, two years later. This engine had steam-cylinders 9
inches in diameter, 2 feet stroke of piston, one pair of drivers
4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter, and weighed 10 tons. This engine,
and that built by Phineas Davis for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
Railroad, were exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition at
Philadelphia, in the year 1876.</p>

<p>Engines supplied to the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad
subsequent to 1831 were built from the designs of Robert
L. Stevens, in the shop of the Messrs. Stevens, at
Hoboken. The other principal roads of the country, at
first, very generally purchased their engines of the Baldwin
Locomotive Works, then a small shop owned by Matthias
W. Baldwin. Baldwin&#8217;s first engine was a little model
built for Peale&#8217;s Museum, to illustrate to the visitors of that
then well-known place of entertainment the character of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
new motor, the success of which, at Rainhill, had just then
excited the attention of the world. This was in 1831, and
the successful working of this little model led to his receiving
an order for an engine from the Philadelphia &amp;
Germantown Railroad. Mr. Baldwin, after studying the
new engine of the Camden &amp; Amboy road, made his plans,
and built an engine (<a href="#Fig64">Fig. 64</a>), completing it in the autumn
of 1832, and setting it in operation November 23d of that
year. It was kept at work on that line of road for a period
of 20 years or more. This engine was of Stephenson&#8217;s
&#8220;Planet&#8221; class, mounted on two driving-wheels 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in
diameter each, and two separate wheels of the same size,
uncoupled. The steam-cylinders were 9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter,
18 inches stroke of piston, and were placed horizontally
on each side of the smoke-box. The boiler, 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter,
contained 72 copper tubes 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter and 7
feet long. The engine cost the railroad company $3,500.
On the trial, steam was raised in 20 minutes, and the maximum
speed noted was 28 miles an hour. The engine subsequently
attained a speed of over 30 miles. In 1834, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Baldwin completed for Mr. E. L. Miller, of Charleston, a
six-wheeled engine, the &#8220;E. L. Miller&#8221; (<a href="#Fig65">Fig. 65</a>), with cylinders
10 inches in diameter and 16 inches stroke of piston.
He made the boiler of this engine of a form which remained
standard many years, with a high dome over the fire-box.
At about the same time, he built the &#8220;Lancaster,&#8221; an engine
resembling the &#8220;Miller,&#8221; for the State road to Columbia,
and several others were soon contracted for and built. By
the end of 1834, 5 engines had been built by him, and the
construction of locomotive-engines had become one of the
leading and most promising industries of the United States.
Mr. William Norris established a shop in Philadelphia in
1832, which he gradually enlarged until it, like the Baldwin
Works, became a large establishment. He usually
built a six-wheeled engine, with a leading-truck or bogie,
and placed his driving-wheels in front of the fire-box.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig65" id="Fig65"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;E. L. Miller,&#8221; 1834.</p></div>

<p>At this time the English locomotives were built to carry
60 pounds of steam. The American builders adopted pressures
of 120 to 130 pounds per square inch, the now generally
standard pressures throughout the world. In the years
1836 and 1837, Baldwin built 80 engines. They were of
three classes: 1st, with cylinders 12<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter
and of 16 inches stroke, weighing 12 tons; 2d, with cylinders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
12 by 16, and a weight of 10<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons; and 3d, engines
weighing 9 tons, and having steam-cylinders of 10<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches
diameter and of the same stroke. The driving-wheels were
usually 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter, and the cylinder &#8220;inside-connected&#8221;
to cranked axles. A few &#8220;outside-connected&#8221; engines
were made, this plan becoming generally adopted at
a later period.</p>

<p>The railroads of the United States were very soon supplied
with locomotive-engines built in America. In the
year 1836, William Norris, who had two years before purchased
the interest of Colonel Stephen H. Long, an army-officer
who patented and built locomotives of his own design,
built the &#8220;George Washington,&#8221; and set it at work.
This engine, weighing 14,400 pounds, drew 19,200 pounds
up an incline 2,800 feet long, rising 369 feet to the mile, at
the speed of 15<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles an hour. This showed an adhesion
not far from one-third the weight on the driving-wheels.
This was considered a very wonderful performance, and it
produced such an impression at the time, that several copies
of the &#8220;George Washington&#8221; were made, on orders from
British railroads, and the result was the establishment of
the reputation of the locomotive-engine builders of the
United States upon a foundation which has never since
failed them. The engine had Jervis&#8217;s forward-truck, now
always seen under standard engines, which had already been
placed under railroad-cars by Ross Winans.</p>

<p>In New England, the Locks &amp; Canals Company, of
Lowell, began building engines as early as 1834, copying
the Stephenson engine. Hinckley &amp; Drury, of Boston,
commenced building an outside-connected engine in 1840,
and their successors, the Boston Locomotive Works, became
the largest manufacturing establishment of the kind in New
England. Two years later, Ross Winans, the Baltimore
builder, introduced some of his engines upon Eastern railroads,
fitting them with upright boilers, and burning anthracite
coal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>The changes which have been outlined produced the
now typical American locomotive. It was necessarily given
such form that it would work safely and efficiently on rough,
ill-ballasted, and often sharply-winding tracks; and thus it
soon became evident that the two pairs of coupled driving-wheels,
carrying two-thirds the weight of the whole engine,
the forward-truck, and the system of &#8220;equalizing&#8221; suspension-bars,
by which the weight is distributed fairly among
all the wheels, whatever the position of the engine, or whatever
the irregularity of the track, made it the very best of
all known types of locomotive for the railroads of a new
country. Experience has shown it equally excellent on the
smoothest and best of roads. The &#8220;cow-catcher,&#8221; placed
in front to remove obstacles from the track, the bell, and
the heavy whistle, are characteristics of the American engine
also. The severity of winter-storms compelled the
adoption of the &#8220;cab,&#8221; or house, and the use of wood for
fuel led to the invention of the &#8220;spark-arrester&#8221; for that
class of engines. The heavy grades on many roads led to
the use of the &#8220;sand-box,&#8221; from which sand was sprinkled
on the track, to prevent the slipping of the wheels.</p>

<p>In the year 1836, the now standard chilled wheel was
introduced for cars and trucks; the single eccentric, which
had been, until then, used on Baldwin engines, was displaced
by the double eccentric, with hooks in place of the
link; and, a year later, the iron frame took the place of
the previously-used wooden frame on all engines.</p>

<p>The year 1837 introduced a period of great depression
in all branches of industry, which continued until the year
1840, or later, and seriously checked all kinds of manufacturing,
including the building of locomotives. On the revival
of business, numbers of new locomotive-works were
started, and in these establishments originated many new
types of engine, each of the more successful of which was
adapted to some peculiar set of conditions. This variety of
type is still seen on nearly all of the principal roads.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>The direction of change in the construction of locomotive-engines
at the period at which this division of the subject
terminates is very well indicated in a letter from Robert
Stephenson to Robert L. Stevens, dated 1833, which is
now preserved at the Stevens Institute of Technology. He
writes: &#8220;I am sorry that the feeling in the United States
in favor of light railways is so general. In England we are
making every succeeding railway stronger and more substantial.&#8221;
He adds: &#8220;Small engines are losing ground,
and large ones are daily demonstrating that powerful engines
are the most economical.&#8221; He gives a sketch of his
latest engine, weighing <i>nine tons</i>, and capable, as he states,
of &#8220;taking 100 tons, gross load, at the rate of 16 or 17 miles
an hour on a level.&#8221; To-day there are engines built weighing
70 tons, and our locomotive-builders have standard sizes
guaranteed to draw over 2,000 tons on a good and level
track.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Second Period of Application&mdash;1800-1850 (continued).
The Steam-Engine Applied to Ship-Propulsion.</span></h4>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>Among the most obviously important and most inconceivably
fruitful of all the applications of steam which marked
the period we are now studying, is that of the steam-engine
to the propulsion of vessels. This direction of application
has been that which has, from the earliest period in
the history of the steam-engine, attracted the attention of
the political economist and the historian, as well as the
mechanician, whenever a new improvement, or the revival
of an old device, has awakened a faint conception of the
possibilities attendant upon the introduction of a machine
capable of making so great a force available. The realization
of the hopes, the prophecies, and the aspirations of
earlier times, in the modern marine steam-engine, may be
justly regarded as the greatest of all the triumphs of mechanical
engineering. Although, as has already been stated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
attempts were made at a very early period to effect this
application of steam-power, they were not successful, and
the steamship is a product of the present century. No
such attempts were commercially successful until after the
time of Newcomen and Watt, and at the commencement of
the nineteenth century. It is, indeed, but a few years since
the passage across the Atlantic was frequently made in
sailing-vessels, and the dangers, the discomforts, and the
irregularities of their trips were most serious. Now, hardly
a day passes that does not see several large and powerful
steamers leaving the ports of New York and Liverpool to
make the same voyages, and their passages are made with
such regularity and safety, that travelers can anticipate with
confidence the time of their arrival at the termination of
their voyage to a day, and can cross with safety and with
comparative comfort even amid the storms of winter. Yet all
that we to-day see of the extent and the efficiency of steam-navigation
has been the work of the present century, and it
may well excite our wonder and our admiration.</p>

<p>The history of this development of the use of steam-power
illustrates most perfectly that process of growth of
this invention which has been already referred to; and
we can here trace it, step by step, from the earliest and
rudest devices up to those most recent and most perfect designs
which represent the most successful existing types of
the heat-engine&mdash;whether considered with reference to its
design and construction, or as the highest application of
known scientific principles&mdash;that have yet been seen in even
the present advanced state of the mechanic arts.</p>

<p>The paddle-wheel was used as a substitute for oars at a
very early date, and a description of paddle-wheels applied
to vessels, curiously illustrated by a large wood-cut, may be
found in the work of Fammelli, &#8220;De l&#8217;artificioses machines,&#8221;
published in old French in 1588. Clark<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a
href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> quotes from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Ogilby&#8217;s edition of the &#8220;Odyssey&#8221; a stanza which reads
like a prophecy, and almost awakens a belief that the
great poet had a knowledge of steam-vessels in those early
times&mdash;a thousand years before the Christian era. The
prince thus addresses Ulysses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Have Souls, and plow with Reason up the deeps;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Through billows glide, veiled in obscuring Mist;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor fear they Rocks, nor Dangers on the way.&#8221;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Promiscuous every guest to every bay.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is stated that the Roman army under Claudius Caudex
was taken across to Sicily in boats propelled by paddle-wheels
turned by oxen. Vulturius gives pictures of such
vessels.</p>

<p>This application of the force of steam was very possibly
anticipated 600 years ago by Roger Bacon, the learned
Franciscan monk, who, in an age of ignorance and intellectual
torpor, wrote:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will now mention some wonderful works of art and
nature, in which there is nothing of magic, and which magic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
could not perform. Instruments may be made by which
the largest ships, with only one man guiding them, will be
carried with greater velocity than if they were full of sailors,&#8221;
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s <a href="#Darwin">poetical prophecy</a> was published long years
before Watt&#8217;s engine rendered its partial fulfillment a possibility;
and thus, for many years before even the first
promising effort had been made, the minds of the more intelligent
had been prepared to appreciate the invention
when it should finally be brought forward.</p>

<p>The earliest attempt to propel a vessel by steam is
claimed by Spanish authorities, as has been stated, to have
been made by Blasco de Garay, in the harbor of Barcelona,
Spain, in 1543. The record, claimed as having been extracted
from the Spanish archives at Simancas, states the
vessel to have been of 200 tons burden, and to have been
moved by paddle-wheels; and it is added that the spectators
saw, although not allowed closely to inspect the apparatus,
that one part of it was a &#8220;vessel of boiling water&#8221;;
and it is also stated that objection was made to the use of
this part of the machine, because of the danger of explosion.</p>

<p>The account seems somewhat apocryphal, and it certainly
led to no useful results.</p>

<p>In an anonymous English pamphlet, published in 1651,
which is supposed by Stuart to have been written by the
Marquis of Worcester, an indefinite reference to what may
probably have been the steam-engine is made, and it is
there stated to be capable of successful application to propelling
boats.</p>

<p>In 1690, Papin proposed to use his piston-engine to
drive paddle-wheels to propel vessels; and in 1707 he applied
the steam-engine, which he had proposed as a pumping-engine,
to driving a model boat on the Fulda at Cassel.
In this trial he used the arrangement of which a sketch has
been shown, his pumping-engine forcing up water to turn a
water-wheel, which, in turn, was made to drive the paddles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
An account of his experiments is to be found in manuscript
in the correspondence between Leibnitz and Papin, preserved
in the Royal Library at Hanover. Professor Joy
found there the following letter:<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a
href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Dionysius Papin, Councillor and Physician to his Royal Highness the
Elector of Cassel, also Professor of Mathematics at Marburg, is about to
dispatch a vessel of singular construction down the river Weser to Bremen.
As he learns that all ships coming from Cassel, or any point on the Fulda,
are not permitted to enter the Weser, but are required to unload at M&uuml;nden,
and as he anticipates some difficulty, although those vessels have a different
object, his own not being intended for freight, he begs most humbly
that a gracious order be granted that his ship may be allowed to pass unmolested
through the Electoral domain; which petition I most humbly support.</p>

<p class="smcap right">G. W. Leibnitz.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hanover</span>, <i>July 13, 1707</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This letter was returned to Leibnitz, with the following
indorsement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Electoral Councillors have found serious obstacles in the way of
granting the above petition, and, without giving their reasons, have directed
me to inform you of their decision, and that, in consequence, the request is
not granted by his Electoral Highness.</p>

<p class="smcap right">H. Reiche.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hanover</span>, <i>July 25, 1707</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This failure of Papin&#8217;s petition was the death-blow to
his effort to establish steam-navigation. A mob of boatmen,
who thought they saw in the embryo steamship the
ruin of their business, attacked the vessel at night, and utterly
destroyed it. Papin narrowly escaped with his life,
and fled to England.</p>

<p>In the year 1736, Jonathan Hulls took out an English
patent for the use of a steam-engine for ship-propulsion,
proposing to employ his steamboat in towing. In 1737 he
published a well-written pamphlet, describing this apparatus,
which is shown in <a href="#Fig66">Fig. 66</a>, a reduced fac-simile of
the plate accompanying his paper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>He proposed using the Newcomen engine, fitted with a
counterpoise-weight and a system of ropes and grooved
wheels, which, by a peculiar ratchet-like action, gave a continuous
rotary motion. His vessel was to have been used
as a tow-boat. He says, in his description: &#8220;In some convenient
part of the Tow-boat there is placed a Vessel about
two-3rds full of water, with the Top closed; and this Vessel
being kept Boiling, rarifies the Water into a Steam, this
Steam being convey&#8217;d thro&#8217; a large pipe into a cylindrical
Vessel, and there condensed, makes a Vacuum, which causes
the weight of the atmosphere to press down on this Vessel,
and so presses down a Piston that is fitted into this Cylindrical
Vessel, in the same manner as in Mr. Newcomen&#8217;s
Engine, with which he raises Water by Fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>P</i>, the Pipe coming from the Furnace to the Cylinder.
<i>Q</i>, the Cylinder wherein the steam is condensed. <i>R</i>, the
Valve that stops the Steam from coming into the Cylinder,
whilst the Steam within the same is condensed. <i>S</i>, the
Pipe to convey the condensing Water into the Cylinder.
<i>T</i>, a cock to let in the condensing Water when the Cylinder
is full of Steam and the Valve, <i>P</i>, is shut. <i>U</i>, a Rope fixed
to the Piston that slides up and down in the Cylinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Note.</i> This Rope, <i>U</i>, is the same Rope that goes round
the wheel, <i>D</i>, in the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the large division of his plate, <i>A</i> is the chimney;
<i>B</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
is the tow-boat; <i>CC</i> is the frame carrying the engine;
<i>Da</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>Db</i> are three wheels carrying the ropes <i>M</i>,
<i>Fb</i>, and <i>Fa</i>, <i>M</i> being the rope <i>U</i> of his smaller figure, 30.
<i>Ha</i> and <i>Hb</i> are two wheels on the paddle-shafts, <i>II</i>, arranged
with pawls so that the paddle-wheel, <i>II</i>, always
turns the same way, though the wheels <i>Ha</i> and <i>Hb</i> are
given a reciprocating motion; <i>Fb</i> is a rope connecting
the wheels in the vessel, <i>Db</i>, with the wheels at the stern.
Hulls says:</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Weight, <i>G</i>, is so raised, while the wheels
<i>Da</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>Db</i> are moving backward, the Rope <i>Fa</i> gives
way, and the Power of the Weight, <i>G</i>, brings the Wheel
<i>Ha</i> forward, and the Fans with it, so that the Fans always
keep going forward, notwithstanding the Wheels <i>Da</i>, <i>D</i>,
and <i>Db</i> move backward and forward as the Piston moves
up and down in the Cylinder. <i>LL</i> are Teeth for a Catch
to drop in from the Axis, and are so contrived that they
catch in an alternate manner, to cause the Fan to move
always forward, for the Wheel <i>Ha</i>, by the power of the
weight, <i>G</i>, is performing his Office while the other wheel,
<i>Hb</i>, goes back in order to fetch another stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Note.</i> The weight, <i>G</i>, must contain but half the weight
of the Pillar of Air pressing on the Piston, because the
weight, <i>G</i>, is raised at the same time as the Wheel <i>Hb</i> performs
its Office, so that it is in effect two Machines acting
alternately, by the weight of one Pillar of Air, of such a
Diameter as the Diameter of the Cylinder is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inventor suggests the use of timber guards to protect
the wheels from injury, and, in shallow water, the attachment
to the paddle-shafts of cranks &#8220;to strike a Shaft
to the Bottom of the River, which will drive the Vessel
forward with the greater Force.&#8221; He concludes: &#8220;Thus I
have endeavoured to give a clear and satisfactory Account
of my New-invented Machine, for carrying Vessels out of
and into any Port, Harbour, or River, against Wind and
Tide, or in a Calm; and I doubt not but whoever shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
give himself the Trouble to peruse this Essay, will be so
candid as to excuse or overlook any Imperfections in the
diction or manner of writing, considering the Hand it comes
from, if what I have imagined may only appear as plain to
others as it has done to me, viz., That the Scheme I now
offer is Practicable, and if encouraged will be Useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no positive evidence that Hulls ever put his
scheme to the test of experiment, although tradition does
say that he made a model, which he tried with such ill success
as to prevent his prosecution of the experiment further;
and doggerel rhymes are still extant which were sung
by his neighbors in derision of his folly, as they considered
it.</p>

<p>A prize was awarded by the French Academy of Sciences,
in 1752, for the best essay on the manner of impelling
vessels without wind. It was given to Bernouilli, who,
in his paper, proposed a set of vanes like those of a windmill&mdash;a
screw, in fact&mdash;one to be placed on each side of the
vessel, and two more behind. For a vessel of 100 tons, he
proposed a shaft 14 feet long and 2 inches in diameter, carrying
&#8220;eight wheels, for acting on the water, to each of
which it&#8221; (the shaft) &#8220;is perpendicular, and forms an axis
for them all; the wheels should be at equal distances from
each other. Each wheel consists of 8 arms of iron, each 3
feet long, so that the whole diameter of the wheel is 6 feet.
Each of these arms, at the distance of 20 inches from the
centre, carries a sheet-iron plane (or paddle) 16 inches
square, which is inclined so as to form an angle of 60 degrees,
both with the arbor and keel of the vessel, to which
the arbor is placed parallel. To sustain this arbor and
the wheels, two strong bars of iron, between 2 and 3
inches thick, proceed from the side of the vessel at right
angles to it, about 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet below the surface of the water.&#8221;
He proposed similar screw-propellers at the stern, and
suggested that they could be driven by animal or by steam-power.</p>

But a more remarkable essay is quoted by Figuier<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a
href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>&mdash;the
paper of l&#8217;Abb&eacute; Gauthier, published in the &#8220;M&eacute;moires de
la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Royale des Sciences et Lettres de Nancy.&#8221; Bernouilli
had expressed the belief that the best steam-engine
then known&mdash;that of Newcomen&mdash;was not superior to some
other motors. Gauthier proposed to use that engine in
the propulsion of paddle-wheels placed at the side of
the vessel. His plan was not brought into use, but his
paper embodied a glowing description of the advantages
to be secured by its adoption. He states that a
galley urged by 26 oars on a side made but 4,320 toises
(8,420 meters), or about 5 miles, an hour, and required
a crew of 260 men. A steam-engine, doing the same
work, would be ready for action at all times, could
be applied, when not driving the vessel, to raising the
anchor, working the pumps, and to ventilating the ship,
while the fire would also serve to cook with. The engine
would occupy less space and weight than the men, would
require less aliment, and that of a less expensive kind, etc.
He would make the boiler safe against explosions by bands
of iron; would make the fire-box of iron, with a water-filled
ash-pit and base-plate. His injection-water was to
come from the sea, and return by a delivery-pipe placed
above the water-line. The chains, usually leading from the
end of the beam to the pump-rods, were to be carried
around wheels on the paddle-shaft, which were to be provided
with pawls entering a ratchet, and thus the paddles,
having been given several revolutions by the descent of the
piston and the unwinding of the chain, were to revolve
freely while the return-stroke was made, the chain being
hauled down and rewound by the wheel on the shaft, the
latter being moved by a weight. The engine was proposed
to be of 6 feet stroke, and to make 15 strokes per minute,
with a force of 11,000 pounds.</p>

<p>A little later (1760), a Swiss clergyman, J. A. Genevois,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
published in London a paper relating to the improvement
of navigation,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
in which his plan was proposed of compressing
springs by steam or other power, and applying their
effort while recovering their form to ship-propulsion.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the first attempts were made in
the United States to solve this problem, which had begun
to be recognized as one of the greatest which had presented
itself to the mechanic and the engineer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Henry</span> was a prominent citizen of the then little
village of Lancaster, Pa., and was noted as an ingenious
and successful mechanic.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He was still living at the beginning
of the present century. Mr. Henry was the first to make
the &#8220;rag&#8221; carpet, and was the inventor of the screw-auger.
He was of a Scotch and North-of-Ireland family, his father,
John Henry, and his two older brothers, Robert and James,
having come to the United States about 1720. Robert settled,
finally, in Virginia, and it is said that Patrick Henry,
the patriot and orator, was of his family. The others remained
in Chester County, Pa., where William was born,
in 1729. He learned the trade of a gunsmith, and, driven
from his home during the Indian war (1755 to 1760), settled
in Lancaster.</p>

<p>In the year 1760 he went to England on business, where
his attention was attracted to the invention&mdash;then new, and
the subject of discussion in every circle&mdash;of James Watt.
He saw the possibility of its application to navigation and to
driving carriages, and, on his return home, commenced the
construction of a steam-engine, and finished it in 1763.</p>

<p>Placing it in a boat fitted with paddle-wheels, he made
a trial of the new machine on the Conestoga River, near
Lancaster, where the craft, by some accident, sank,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
was lost. He was not discouraged by this failure, but
made a second model, adding some improvements. Among
the records of the Pennsylvania Philosophical Society is, or
was, a design, presented by Henry in 1782, of one of his
steamboats. The German traveler Sch&ouml;pff visited the
United States in 1783, and at Mr. Henry&#8217;s house, at Lancaster,
was shown &#8220;a machine by Mr. Henry, intended for
the propelling of boats, etc.; &#8216;but,&#8217; said Mr. Henry, &#8216;I am
doubtful whether such a machine would find favor with
the public, as every one considers it impracticable against
wind and tide;&#8217; but that such a Boat <i>will</i> come into use
and navigate on the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi,
he had not the least doubt of, but the time had not yet
arrived of its being appreciated and applied.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Fitch, whose experiments will presently be referred
to, was an acquaintance and frequent visitor to the
house of Mr. Henry, and may probably have there received
the earliest suggestions of the importance of this application
of steam. About 1777, when Henry was engaged in
making mathematical and philosophical instruments, and
the screw-auger, which at that time could only be obtained
of him, Robert Fulton, then twelve years old, visited him,
to study the paintings of Benjamin West, who had long
been a friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Henry. He, too, not improbably
received there the first suggestion which afterward led
him to desert the art to which he at first devoted himself,
and which made of the young portrait-painter a successful
inventor and engineer. West&#8217;s acquaintance with Henry
had no such result. The young painter was led by his
patron and friend to attempt historical pictures,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a
href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and probably
owes his fame greatly to the kindly and discerning
mechanic. Says Galt, in his &#8220;Memoirs of Sir Benjamin
West&#8221; (London, 1816): &#8220;Towards his old friend, William
Henry, of Lancaster City, he always cherished the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
grateful affection; he was the first who urged him to attempt
historical composition.&#8221;</p>

<p>When, after the invention of Watt, the steam-engine
had taken such shape that it could really work the propelling
apparatus of a paddle or screw vessel, a new impetus
was given to the work of its adaptation. In France, the
Marquis de Jouffroy was one of the earliest to perceive that
the improvements of Watt, rendering the engine more compact,
more powerful, and, at the same time, more regular
and positive in its action, had made it, at last, readily applicable
to the propulsion of vessels. The brothers P&eacute;rier
had imported a Watt engine from Soho, and this was attentively
studied by the marquis,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a
href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and its application to the
paddle-wheels of a steam-vessel seemed to him a simple
problem. Comte d&#8217;Auxiron and Chevalier Charles Mounin,
of Follenai, friends and companions of Jouffroy, were
similarly interested, and the three are said to have often
discussed the scheme together, and to have united in devising
methods of applying the new motor.</p>

<p>In the year 1770, D&#8217;Auxiron determined to attempt the
realization of the plans which he had conceived. He resigned
his position in the army, prepared his plans and
drawings, and presented them to M. Bertin, the Prime
Minister, in the year 1771 or 1772. The Minister was favorably
impressed, and the King (May 22, 1772) granted
D&#8217;Auxiron a monopoly of the use of steam in river-navigation
for 15 years, provided he should prove his plans practicable,
and they should be so adjudged by the Academy.</p>

<p>A company had been formed, the day previous, consisting
of D&#8217;Auxiron, Jouffroy, Comte de Dijon, the Marquis
d&#8217;Yonne, and Follenai, which advanced the requisite
funds. The first vessel was commenced in December, 1772.
When nearly completed, in September, 1774, the boat
sprung a leak, and, one night, foundered at the wharf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
After some angry discussion, during which d&#8217;Auxiron was
rudely, and probably unjustly, accused of bad faith, the
company declined to advance the money needed to recover
and complete the vessel. They were, however, compelled
by the court to furnish it; but, meantime, d&#8217;Auxiron died
of apoplexy, the matter dropped, and the company dissolved.
The cost of the experiment had been something
more than 15,000 francs.</p>

<p>The heirs of d&#8217;Auxiron turned the papers of the deceased
inventor over to Jouffroy, and the King transferred
to him the monopoly held by the former. Follenai retained
all his interest in the project, and the two friends soon enlisted
a powerful adherent and patron, the Marquis Ducrest,
a well-known soldier, courtier, and member of the Academy,
who took an active part in the prosecution of the
scheme. M. Jacques P&eacute;rier, the then distinguished mechanic,
was consulted, and prepared plans, which were
adopted in place of those of Jouffroy. The boat was built
by P&eacute;rier, and a trial took place in 1774, on the Seine.
The result was unsatisfactory. The little craft could hardly
stem the sluggish current of the river, and the failure caused
the immediate abandonment of the scheme by P&eacute;rier.</p>

<p>Still undiscouraged, Jouffroy retired to his country
home, at Baume-les-Dames, on the river Doubs. There he
carried on his experiments, getting his work done as best
he could, with the rude tools and insufficient apparatus of a
village blacksmith. A Watt engine and a chain carrying
&#8220;duck-foot&#8221; paddles were his propelling apparatus. The
boat, which was about 14 feet long and 6 wide, was started
in June, 1776. The duck&#8217;s-foot system of paddles proved
unsatisfactory, and Jouffroy gave it up, and renewed his
experiments with a new arrangement. He placed on the
paddle-wheel shaft a ratchet-wheel, and on the piston-rod
of his engine, which was placed horizontally in the boat,
a double rack, into the upper and the lower parts of which
the ratchet-wheel geared. Thus the wheels turned in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
same direction, whichever way the piston was moving.
The new engine was built at Lyons in 1780, by Messrs.
Fr&egrave;res-Jean. The new boat was about 140 feet long and
14 feet wide; the wheels were 14 feet in diameter, their
floats 6 feet long, and the &#8220;dip,&#8221; or depth to which they
reached, was about 2 feet. The boat drew 3 feet of water,
and had a total weight of about 150 tons.</p>

<p>At a public trial of the vessel at Lyons, July 15, 1783,
the little steamer was so successful as to justify the publication
of the fact by a report and a proclamation. The
fact that the experiment was not made at Paris was made
an excuse on the part of the Academy for withholding its
indorsement, and on the part of the Government for declining
to confirm to Jouffroy the guaranteed monopoly. Impoverished
and discouraged, Jouffroy gave up all hope of
prosecuting his plans successfully, and re&euml;ntered the army.
Thus France lost an honor which was already within her
grasp, as she had already lost that of the introduction of
the steam-engine, in the time of Papin.</p>

<p>About 1785, John Fitch and James Rumsey were engaged
in experiments having in view the application of
steam to navigation.</p>

<p>Rumsey&#8217;s experiments began in 1774, and in 1786 he
succeeded in driving a boat at the rate of four miles an hour
against the current of the Potomac at Shepherdstown, W.
Va., in presence of General Washington. His method of
propulsion has often been reinvented since, and its adoption
urged with that enthusiasm and persistence which is a peculiar
characteristic of inventors.</p>

<p>Rumsey employed his engine to drive a great pump
which forced a stream of water aft, thus propelling the
boat forward, as proposed earlier by Bernouilli. This
same method has been recently tried again by the British
Admiralty, in a gunboat of moderate size, using a centrifugal
pump to set in motion the propelling stream, and with
some other modifications which are decided improvements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
upon Rumsey&#8217;s rude arrangements, but which have not
done much more than his toward the introduction of
&#8220;Hydraulic or Jet Propulsion,&#8221; as it is now called.</p>

<p>In 1787 he obtained a patent from the State of Virginia
for steam-navigation. He wrote a treatise &#8220;On the Application
of Steam,&#8221; which was printed at Philadelphia, where
a Rumsey society was organized for the encouragement of
attempts at steam-navigation.</p>

<p>Rumsey died of apoplexy, while explaining some of his
schemes before a London society a short time later, December
23, 1793, at the age of fifty years. A boat, then in
process of construction from his plans, was afterward tried
on the Thames, in 1793, and steamed at the rate of four
miles an hour. The State of Kentucky, in 1839, presented
his son with a gold medal, commemorative of his father&#8217;s
services &#8220;in giving to the world the benefit of the steamboat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Fitch</span> was an unfortunate and eccentric, but very
ingenious, Connecticut mechanic. After roaming about
until forty years of age, he finally settled on the banks of
the Delaware, where he built his first steamboat.</p>

<p>In April, 1785, as Fitch himself states, at Neshamony,
Bucks County, Pa., he suddenly conceived the idea that a
carriage might be driven by steam. After considering the
subject a few days, his attention was led to the plan of
using steam to propel vessels, and from that time to the
day of his death he was a persistent advocate of the introduction
of the steamboat. At this time, Fitch says, &#8220;I
did not know that there was a steam-engine on the earth;&#8221;
and he was somewhat disappointed when his friend, the
Rev. Mr. Irwin, of Neshamony, showed him a sketch of
one in &#8220;Martin&#8217;s Philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fitch&#8217;s first model was at once built, and was soon after
tried on a small stream near Davisville. The machinery
was made of brass, and the boat was impelled by paddle-wheels.
A rough model of his steamboat was shown to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Dr. John Ewing, Provost of the University of Pennsylvania,
who, August 20, 1785, addressed a commendatory
letter to an ex-Member of Congress, William C. Houston,
asking him to assist Fitch in securing the aid of the General
Government. The latter referred the inventor, by a letter
of recommendation, to a delegate from New Jersey, Mr.
Lambert Cadwalader. With this, and other letters, Fitch
proceeded to New York, where Congress then met, and
made his application in proper form. He was unsuccessful,
and equally so in attempting to secure aid from the
Spanish minister, who desired that the profits should be
secured, by a monopoly of the invention, to the King of
Spain. Fitch declined further negotiation, determined
that, if successful at all, the benefit should accrue to his
own countrymen.</p>

<p>In September, 1785, Fitch presented to the American
Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia, a model in which he
had substituted an endless chain and floats for the paddle-wheels,
with drawings and a descriptive account of his
scheme. This model is shown in the <a href="#Fig67">accompanying figure</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig67" id="Fig67"></a>
<img src="images/illo263.png" alt="Fitch's Model" width="400" height="108" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;Fitch&#8217;s Model, 1785.</p></div>

<p>In March, 1786, Fitch was granted a patent by the
State of New Jersey, for the exclusive right to the navigation
of the waters of the State by steam, for 14 years. A
month later, he was in Philadelphia, seeking a similar
patent from the State of Pennsylvania. He did not at once
succeed, but in a few days he had formed a company, raised
$300, and set about finding a place in which to construct
his engine. Henry Voight, a Dutch watchmaker, a good
mechanic, and a very ingenious man, took an interest in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
company, and with him Fitch set about his work with great
enthusiasm. After making a little model, having a steam-cylinder
but one inch in diameter, they built a model boat
and engine, the latter having a diameter of cylinder of three
inches. They tried the endless chain, and other methods of
propulsion, without success, and finally succeeded with a set
of oars worked by the engine. In August, 1786, it was determined
by the company to authorize the construction of a
larger vessel; but the money was not readily obtained.
Meantime, Fitch continued his efforts to secure a patent
from the State, and was finally, March 28, 1787, successful.
He also obtained a similar grant from the State of
Delaware, in February of the same year, and from New
York, March 19.</p>

<p>Money was now subscribed more freely, and the work
on the boat continued uninterruptedly until May, 1787,
when a trial was made, which revealed many defects in the
machinery. The cylinder-heads were of wood, and leaked
badly; the piston leaked; the condenser was imperfect;
the valves were not tight. All these defects were remedied,
and a condenser invented by Voight&mdash;the &#8220;pipe-condenser&#8221;&mdash;was
substituted for that defective detail as previously
made.</p>

<p>The steamboat was finally placed in working order, and
was found capable, on trial, of making three or four miles
an hour. But now the boiler proved to be too small to furnish
steam steadily in sufficient quantity to sustain the
higher speed. After some delay, and much distress on the
part of the sanguine inventor, who feared that he might be
at last defeated when on the very verge of success, the
necessary changes were finally made, and a trial took place
at Philadelphia, in presence of the members of the Convention&mdash;then
in session at Philadelphia framing the Federal
Constitution&mdash;August 22, 1787. Many of the distinguished
spectators gave letters to Fitch certifying his success. Fitch
now went to Virginia, where he succeeded in obtaining a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
patent, November 7, 1787, and then returned to ask a patent
of the General Government.</p>

<p>A controversy with Rumsey now followed, in which
Fitch asserted his claims to the invention of the steamboat,
and denied that Rumsey had done more than to revive the
scheme which Bernouilli, Franklin, Henry, Paine, and
others, had previously proposed, and that Rumsey&#8217;s <i>steamboat</i>
was not made until 1786.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig68" id="Fig68"></a>
<img src="images/illo265a.png" alt="Fitch and Voight's Boiler" width="291" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;Fitch and Voight&#8217;s Boiler, 1787.</p></div>

<p>The boiler adopted in Fitch&#8217;s boat of 1787 was a &#8220;pipe-boiler,&#8221;
which he had described in a communication to the
Philosophical Society, in September, 1785. It consisted
(<a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a>) of a small water-pipe, winding backward and forward
in the furnace, and terminating at one end at the
point at which the feed-water was introduced, and at the
other uniting with the steam-pipe leading to the engine.
Voight&#8217;s condenser was similarly constructed. Rumsey
claimed that this boiler was copied from his designs. Fitch
brought evidence to prove that Rumsey had not built such
a boiler until after his own.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig69" id="Fig69"></a>
<img src="images/illo265b.png" alt="Fitch's First Boat" width="286" height="400" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;Fitch&#8217;s First Boat, 1787.</p></div>

<p>Fitch&#8217;s first boat-engine had a steam-cylinder 12 inches
in diameter. A second engine was now built (1788) with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cylinder 18 inches in diameter, and a new boat. The first
vessel was 45 feet long and 12 feet wide; the new boat was
60 feet long and of but 8 feet breadth of beam. The first
boat (<a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a>) had paddles worked at the sides, with the
motion given the Indian paddle in propelling a canoe; in
the second boat (<a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a>) they were similarly worked, but
were placed at the stern. There were three of these paddles.
The boat was finally finished in July, 1788, and made
a trip to Burlington, 20 miles from Philadelphia. When
just reaching their destination, their boiler gave out, and
they made their return-trip to Philadelphia floating with
the tide. Subsequently, the boat made a number of excursions
on the Delaware River, making three or four miles an
hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig70" id="Fig70"></a>
<img src="images/illo266.png" alt="Fitch's Second Boat" width="422" height="300" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;John Fitch, 1788.</p></div>

<p>Another of Fitch&#8217;s boats, in April, 1790, made seven
miles an hour. Fitch, writing of this boat, says that &#8220;on
the 16th of April we got our work completed, and tried
our boat again; and, although the wind blew very fresh at
the east, we reigned lord high admirals of the Delaware,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and no boat on the river could hold way with us.&#8221; In
June of that year it was placed as a passenger-boat on a
line from Philadelphia to Burlington, Bristol, Bordentown,
and Trenton, occasionally leaving that route to take excursions
to Wilmington and Chester. During this period, the
boat probably ran between 2,000 and 3,000 miles,<a name="FNanchor_67_67"
id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and with
no serious accident. During the winter of 1790-&#8217;91, Fitch
commenced another steamboat, the &#8220;Perseverance,&#8221; and
gave considerable time to the prosecution of his claim for a
patent from the United States. The boat was never completed,
although he received his patent, after a long and
spirited contest with other claimants, on the 26th of August,
1791, and Fitch lost all hope of success. He went to
France in 1793, hoping to obtain the privilege of building
steam-vessels there, but was again disappointed, and worked
his passage home in the following year.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig71" id="Fig71"></a>
<img src="images/illo267.png" alt="Fitch 1796" width="450" height="284" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>&mdash;John Fitch, 1796.</p></div>

<p>In the year 1796, Fitch was again in New York City,
experimenting with a little <i>screw</i> <a href="#Fig71">steamboat</a> on the &#8220;Collect&#8221;
Pond, which then covered that part of the city now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
occupied by the &#8220;Tombs,&#8221; the city prison. This little boat
was a ship&#8217;s yawl fitted with a screw, like that adopted later
by Woodcroft, and driven by a rudely-made engine.</p>

<p>Fitch, while in the city of Philadelphia at about this
time, met Oliver Evans, and discussed with him the probable
future of steam-navigation, and proposed to form a
company in the West, to promote the introduction of steam
on the great rivers of that part of the country. He settled
at last in Kentucky, on his land-grant, and there amused
himself with a model steamboat, which he placed in a small
stream near Bardstown. His death occurred there in July,
1798, and his body still lies in the village cemetery, with
only a rough stone to mark the spot.</p>

<p>Both Rumsey and Fitch endeavored to introduce their
methods in Great Britain; and Fitch, while urging the importance
and the advantages of his plan, confidently stated
his belief that the ocean would soon be crossed by steam-vessels,
and that the navigation of the Mississippi would
also become exclusively a steam-navigation. His reiterated
assertion, &#8220;The day will come when some more
powerful man will get fame and riches from my invention;
but no one will believe that poor John Fitch can do anything
worthy of attention,&#8221; now almost sounds like a
prophecy.</p>

<p>During this period, an interest which had never diminished
in Great Britain had led to the introduction of experimental
steamboats in that country. <span class="smcap">Patrick Miller</span>, of
Dalswinton, had commenced experimenting, in 1786-&#8217;87,
with boats having double or triple hulls, and propelled by
paddle-wheels placed between the parts of the compound
vessel. James Taylor, a young man who had been engaged
as tutor for Mr. Miller&#8217;s sons, suggested, in 1787, the substitution
of steam for the manual power which had been,
up to that time, relied upon in their propulsion. Mr. Miller,
in 1787, printed a description of his plan of propelling

that the power of the Steam-Engine may be applied to work
the wheels.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the winter of 1787-&#8217;88, William Symmington, who
had planned a new form of steam-engine, and made a successful
working-model, was employed by Mr. Miller to construct
an engine for a new boat. This was built; the little engine,
having two cylinders of but four inches in diameter, was
placed on board, and a trial was made October 14, 1788.
The vessel (<a href="#Fig72">Fig. 72</a>) was 25 feet long, of 7 feet beam, and
made 5 miles an hour.</p>

<p>In the year 1789, a large vessel was built, with an engine
having a steam-cylinder 18 inches in diameter, and this vessel
was ready for trial in November of that year. On the
first trial, the paddle-wheels proved too slight, and broke
down; they were replaced by stronger wheels, and, in December,
the boat, on trial, made seven miles an hour.</p>

<p>Miller, like many other inventors, seems to have lost his
interest in the matter as soon as success seemed assured,
and dropped it to take up other incomplete plans. More
than a quarter of a century later, the British Government
gave Taylor a pension of &pound;50 per annum, and, in 1837, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
four daughters were each given a similar annuity. Mr.
Miller received no reward, although he is said to have expended
over &pound;30,000. The engine of Symmington was
condemned by Miller as &#8220;the most improper of all steam-engines
for giving motion to a vessel.&#8221; Nothing more was
done in Great Britain until early in the succeeding century.</p>

<p>In the United States, several mechanics were now at
work besides Fitch. Samuel Morey and Nathan Read were
among these. Nicholas Roosevelt was another. It had
just been found that American mechanics were able to do
the required shop-work. The first experimental steam-engine
built in America is stated to have been made in 1773
by Christopher Colles, a lecturer before the American Philosophical
Society at Philadelphia. The first steam-cylinder
of any considerable size is said<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a
href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> to have been made by
Sharpe &amp; Curtenius, of New York City.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Morey</span> was the son of one of the first settlers
of Orford, N. H. He was naturally fond of science and
mechanics, and became something of an inventor. He began
experimenting with the steamboat in 1790 or earlier,
building a small vessel, and fitting it with paddle-wheels
driven by a steam-engine of his own design, and constructed
by himself.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a
href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> He made a trial-trip one Sunday morning in
the summer of 1790, a friend to accompany him, from Oxford,
up the Connecticut River, to Fairlee, Vt., a distance
of several miles, and returned safely. He then went to
New York, and spent the summer of each year until 1793
in experimenting with his boat and modifications of his
engine. In 1793 he made a trip to Hartford, returning to
New York the next summer. His boat was a &#8220;stern-wheeler,&#8221;
and is stated to have been capable of steaming
five miles an hour. He next went to Bordentown, N. J.,
where he built a larger boat, which is said to have been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
side-wheel boat, and to have worked satisfactorily. His
funds finally gave out, and he gave up his project after
having, in 1797, made a trip to Philadelphia. Fulton,
Livingston, and Stevens met Morey at New York, inspected
his boat, and made an excursion to Greenwich with him.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a
href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Livingston is said<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
to have offered to assist Morey if he
should succeed in attaining a speed of eight miles an hour.</p>

<p>Morey&#8217;s experiments seem to have been conducted very
quietly, however, and almost nothing is known of them.
The author has not been able to learn any particulars of
the engines used by him, and nothing definite is known of
the dimensions of either boat or machinery. Morey never,
like Fitch and Rumsey, sought publicity for his plans or
notoriety for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan Read</span>, who has already been <a href="#Read">mentioned</a>, a native
of Warren, Mass., where he was born in the year 1759,
and a graduate of Harvard College, was a student of medicine,
and subsequently a manufacturer of chain-cables and
other iron-work for ships. He invented, and in 1798 patented,
a nail-making machine. He was at one time (1800-1803)
a Member of Congress, and, later, a Justice of the
Court of Common Pleas, and Chief Justice in Hancock
County, Me., after his removal to that State in 1807. He
died in Belfast, Me., in 1849, at the age of ninety years.</p>

<p>In the year 1788 he became interested in the problem
of steam-navigation, and learned something of the work of
Fitch. He first attempted to design a boiler that should be
strong, light, and compact, as well as safe. His first plan
was that of the &#8220;Portable Furnace-Boiler,&#8221; as he called it;
it was patented August 26, 1791. As designed, it consisted,
as seen in <a href="#Fig73">Figs. 73</a> and <a href="#Fig74">74</a>, which are reduced from his
patent drawings, of a shell of cylindrical form, like the
now common vertical tubular boiler. <i>A</i> is the furnace-door,
<i>B</i> a heater and feed-water reservoir, <i>D</i> a pipe leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the feed-water into the boiler,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72"
class="fnanchor">[72]</a> <i>E</i> the smoke-pipe, and <i>F</i>
the steam-pipe leading to the engine. <i>G</i> is the &#8220;shell&#8221; of
the boiler, and <i>H</i> the fire-box. The crown-sheet, <i>I I</i>, has
depending from it, in the furnace, a set of water-tubes, <i>b b</i>,
closed at their lower ends, and another set, <i>a a</i>, which connect
the water-space above the furnace with the water-bottom,
<i>K K</i>. <i>L</i> is the furnace, and <i>M</i> the draught-space
between the boiler and the ash-pit, in which the grates
are set.</p>

<p>This boiler was intended to be used in both steamboats
and steam-carriages. The first drawings were made in
1788 or 1789, as were those of a peculiar form of steam-engine
which also resembled very closely that afterward
constructed in Great Britain by Trevithick.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> He built a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
boat in 1789, which he fitted with paddle-wheels and a
crank, which was turned by hand, and, by trial, satisfied
himself that the system would work satisfactorily.</p>

<p>He then applied for his patent, and spent the greater
part of the winter of 1789-&#8217;90 in New York, where Congress
then met, endeavoring to secure it. In January, 1791,
Read withdrew his petitions for patents, proposing to incorporate
accounts of new devices, and renewed them a few
months later. His patents were finally issued, dated August
26, 1791. John Fitch, James Rumsey, and John Stevens,
also, all received patents at the same date, for various
methods of applying steam to the propulsion of vessels.</p>

<p>Read appears to have never succeeded in even experimentally
making his plans successful. He deserves credit
for his early and intelligent perception of the importance
of the subject, and for the ingenuity of his devices. As
the inventor of the vertical multi-tubular fire-box boiler, he
has also entitled himself to great distinction. This boiler
is now in very general use, and is a standard form.</p>

<p>In 1792, Elijah Ormsbee, a Rhode Island mechanic,
assisted pecuniarily by David Wilkinson, built a small
steamboat at Winsor&#8217;s Cove, Narragansett Bay, and made
a successful trial-trip on the Seekonk River. Ormsbee
used an &#8220;atmospheric engine&#8221; and &#8220;duck&#8217;s-foot&#8221; paddles.
His boat attained a speed of from three to four miles an
hour.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, Lord Dundas and William Symmington,
the former as the purveyor of funds and the latter as
engineer, followed by Henry Bell, were the first to make
the introduction of the steam-engine for the propulsion of
ships so completely successful that no interruption subsequently
took place in the growth of the new system of
water-transportation.</p>

<p>Thomas, Lord Dundas, of Kerse, had taken great interest
in the experiments of Miller, and had hoped to be able
to apply the new motor on the Forth and Clyde Canal, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
which he held a large interest. After the failure of the
earlier experiments, he did not forget the matter; but subsequently,
meeting with Symmington, who had been Miller&#8217;s
constructing engineer, he engaged him to continue
the experiments, and furnished all required capital, about
&pound;7,000. This was ten years after Miller had abandoned
his scheme.</p>

<p>Symmington commenced work in 1801. The first boat
built for Lord Dundas, which has been claimed to have
been the &#8220;first practical steamboat,&#8221; was finished ready for
trial early in 1802. The vessel was called the &#8220;Charlotte
Dundas,&#8221; in honor of a daughter of Lord Dundas, who became
Lady Milton.</p>

<p>The vessel (<a href="#Fig75">Fig. 75</a>) was driven by a Watt double-acting
engine, turning a crank on the paddle-wheel shaft.
The sectional sketch below exhibits the arrangement of the
machinery. <i>A</i> is the steam-cylinder, driving, by means of
the connecting-rod, <i>B C</i>, a stern-wheel, <i>E E</i>. <i>F</i> is the
boiler, and <i>G</i> the tall smoke-pipe. An air-pump and condenser,
<i>H</i>, is seen under the steam-cylinder.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;Charlotte Dundas,&#8221; 1801.</p></div>

<p>In March, 1802, the boat was brought to Lock No. 20
on the Forth and Clyde Canal, and two vessels of 70 tons
burden each taken in tow. Lord Dundas, William Symmington,
and a party of invited guests, were taken on board,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and the boat steamed down to Port Glasgow, a distance of
about 20 miles, against a strong head-wind, in six hours.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the canal were now urged to adopt
the new plan of towing; but, fearing injury to the banks
of the canal, they declined to do so. Lord Dundas then
laid the matter before the Duke of Bridgewater, who gave
Symmington an order for eight boats like the Charlotte
Dundas, to be used on his canal. The death of the Duke,
however, prevented the contract from being carried into
effect, and Symmington again gave up the project in despair.
A quarter of a century later, Symmington received
from the British Government &pound;100, and, a little later, &pound;50
additional, as an acknowledgment of his services. The
Charlotte Dundas was laid up, and we hear nothing more
of that vessel.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig76" id="Fig76"></a>
<img src="images/illo275.png" alt="The 'Comet'" width="400" height="279" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>&mdash;The &#8220;Comet,&#8221; 1812.</p></div>

<p>Among those who saw the Charlotte Dundas, and who
appreciated the importance of the success achieved by Symmington,
was <span class="smcap">Henry Bell</span>, who, 10 years afterward, constructed
the Comet (<a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a>), the first passenger-vessel
built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in Europe. This vessel was built in 1811, and completed
January 18, 1812. The craft was of 30 tons burden, 40 feet
in length, and 10<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet breadth of beam. There were <i>two</i>
paddle-wheels on each side, driven by engines rated at
three horse-power.</p>

<p>Bell had, it is said, been an enthusiastic believer in the
advantages to be secured by this application of steam, from
about 1786. In 1800, and again in 1803, he applied to the
British Admiralty for aid in securing those advantages by
experimentally determining the proper form and proportions
of machinery and vessel; but was not able to convince
the Admiralty of &#8220;the practicability and great utility
of applying steam to the propelling of vessels against
winds and tides, and every obstruction on rivers and seas
where there was depth of water.&#8221; He also wrote to the
United States Government, urging his views in a similar
strain.</p>

<p>Bell&#8217;s boat was, when finished, advertised as a passenger-boat,
to leave Greenock, where the vessel was built, on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, for Glasgow, 24 miles
distant, returning Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
The fare was made &#8220;four shillings for the best cabin, and
three shillings for the second.&#8221; It was some months before
the vessel became considered a trustworthy means of conveyance.
Bell, on the whole, was at first a heavy loser by
his venture, although his boat proved itself a safe, stanch
vessel.</p>

<p>Bell constructed several other boats in 1815, and with
his success steam-navigation in Great Britain was fairly
inaugurated. In 1814 there were five steamers, all Scotch,
regularly working in British waters; in 1820 there were
34, one-half of which were in England, 14 in Scotland, and
the remainder in Ireland. Twenty years later, at the close
of the period to which this chapter is especially devoted,
there were about 1,325 steam-vessels in that kingdom, of
which 1,000 were English and 250 Scotch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>But we must return to America, to witness the first and
most complete success, commercially, in the introduction of
the steamboat.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Stevens, Livingston, Fulton, and Roosevelt
were there the most successful pioneers. The latter is said
to have built the &#8220;Polacca,&#8221; a small steamboat launched on
the Passaic River in 1798. The vessel was 60 feet long,
and had an engine of 20 inches diameter of cylinder and
2 feet stroke, which drove the boat 8 miles an hour, carrying
a party of invited guests, which included the Spanish
Minister. Livingston and John Stevens had induced Roosevelt
to try their plans still earlier,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a
href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> paying the expense of
the experiments. The former adopted the plan of Bernouilli
and Rumsey, using a centrifugal pump to force a jet of
water from the stern; the latter used the screw. Livingston
going to France as United States Minister, Barlow
carried over the plans of the &#8220;Polacca,&#8221; and Roosevelt&#8217;s
friends state that a boat built by them, in conjunction with
Fulton, was a &#8220;sister-ship&#8221; to that vessel. In 1798, Roosevelt
patented a double engine, having cranks set at right
angles. As late as 1814 he received a patent for a steam-vessel,
fitted with paddle-wheels having adjustable floats.
His boat of 1798 is stated by some writers to have been
made by him on joint account of himself, Livingston, and
Stevens. Roosevelt, some years later, was again at work,
associating himself with Fulton in the introduction of
steam-navigation of the rivers of the West.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a
href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In 1798, the Legislature of New York passed a law giving
Chancellor Livingston the exclusive right to steam-navigation
in the waters of the State for a period of 20
years, <i>provided</i> that he should succeed, within a twelve-month,
in producing a boat that should steam four miles
an hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>Livingston did not succeed in complying with the terms
of the act, but, in 1803, he procured the re&euml;nactment of the
law in favor of himself and Robert Fulton, who was then
experimenting in France, after having, in England, watched
the progress of steam-navigation there, and then taken a
patent in this country.</p>

<p class="caption">Robert Fulton.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Port10">Robert Fulton</a></span> was a native of Little Britain, Lancaster
County, Pa., born 1765. He commenced experimenting
with paddle-wheels when a mere boy, in 1779, visiting an
aunt living on the bank of the Conestoga.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a
href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> During his
youth he spent much of his time in the workshops of his
neighborhood, and learned the trade of a watchmaker; but
he adopted, finally, the profession of an artist, and exhibited
great skill in portrait-painting. While his tastes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
at this time taking a decided bent, he is said to have visited
frequently the house of William Henry, already mentioned,
to see the paintings of Benjamin West, who in his youth
had been a kind of prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Mr. Henry; and he may
probably have seen there the model steamboats which Mr.
Henry exhibited, in 1783 or 1784, to the German traveler
Sch&ouml;pff. In later years, Thomas Paine, the author of
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3755">Common Sense</a>,&#8221; at one time lived with Mr. Henry, and
afterward, in 1788, proposed that Congress take up the
subject for the benefit of the country.</p>

<p>Fulton went to England when he came of age, and
studied painting with Benjamin West. He afterward
spent two years in Devonshire, where he met the Duke of
Bridgewater, who afterward so promptly took advantage
of the success of the &#8220;Charlotte Dundas.&#8221;</p>

<p>While in England and in France&mdash;where he went in
1797, and resided some time&mdash;he may have seen something
of the attempts which were beginning to be made to introduce
steam-navigation in both of those countries.</p>

<p>At about this time&mdash;perhaps in 1793&mdash;Fulton gave up
painting as a profession, and became a civil engineer. In
1797 he went to Paris, and commenced experimenting with
submarine torpedoes and torpedo-boats. In 1801 he had
succeeded so well with them as to create much anxiety in
the minds of the English, then at war with France.</p>

<p>He had, as early as 1793, proposed plans for steam-vessels,
both to the United States and the British Governments,
and seems never entirely to have lost sight of the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
While in France he lived with Joel Barlow, who
subsequently became known as a poet, and as Embassador
to France from the United States, but who was then engaged
in business in Paris.</p>

<p>When about leaving the country, Fulton met Robert
Livingston (Chancellor Livingston, as he is often called),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
who was then (1801) Embassador of the United States at
the court of France. Together they discussed the project
of applying steam to navigation, and determined to attempt
the construction of a steamboat on the Seine; and in the
early spring of the year 1802, Fulton having attended Mrs.
Barlow to Plombi&egrave;res, where she had been sent by her physician,
he there made drawings and models, which were
sent or described to Livingston. In the following winter
Fulton completed a model side-wheel boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig77" id="Fig77"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;Fulton&#8217;s Experiments.</p></div>

<p>January 24, 1803, he delivered this model to MM.
Molar, Bordel, and Montgolfier, with a descriptive memoir,
in which he stated that he had, by experiment, proven that
side-wheels were better than the &#8220;chaplet&#8221; (paddle-floats
set on an endless chain).<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a
href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> These gentlemen were then
building for Fulton and Livingston their first boat, on
L&#8217;Isle des Cygnes, in the Seine. In planning this boat, Fulton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had devised many different methods of applying steam
to its propulsion, and had made some experiments to determine
the resistance of fluids. He therefore had been
able to calculate, more accurately than had any earlier inventor,
the relative size and proportions of boat and machinery.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>&mdash;Fulton&#8217;s Table of Resistances.</p></div>

<p>The author has examined a large collection of Fulton&#8217;s
drawings, among which are sketches, very neatly executed,
of many of these plans, including the chaplet, side-wheel,
and stern-wheel boats, driven by various forms of steam-engine,
some working direct, and some geared to the paddle-wheel
shaft. <a href="#Fig77">Figs. 77</a> and <a href="#Fig78">78</a> are engraved from
two of these sheets. The first represents the method
adopted by Fulton to determine the resistance of masses of
wood of various forms and proportions, when towed through
water. The other is &#8220;A Table of the resistance of bodies
moved through water, taken from experiments made in
England by a society for improving Naval architecture, between
the years 1793 and 1798&#8221; (<a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a>). This latter is
from a certified copy of &#8220;The Original Drawing on file in
the Office of the Clerk of the New York District, making
a part of the Demonstration of the patent granted to Robert
Fulton, Esqr., on the 11th day of February, 1809. Dated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
this 3rd March, 1814,&#8221; and is signed by Theron Rudd, Clerk
of the New York District. Resistances are given in pounds
per square foot.</p>

<p>Guided by these experiments and calculations, therefore,
Fulton directed the construction of his vessel. It was completed
in the spring of 1803. But, unfortunately, the hull
of the little vessel was too weak for its heavy machinery,
and it broke in two and sank to the bottom of the Seine.
Undiscouraged, Fulton at once set about repairing damages.
He was compelled to direct the rebuilding of the
hull. The machinery was little injured. In June, 1803,
the reconstruction was completed, and the vessel was set
afloat in July. The hull was 66 feet long, of 8 feet beam,
and of light draught.</p>

<p>August 9, 1803, this boat was cast loose, and steamed
up the Seine, in presence of an immense concourse of spectators.
A committee of the National Academy, consisting
of Bougainville, Bossuet, Carnot, and P&eacute;rier, were present
to witness the experiment. The boat moved but slowly,
making only between 3 and 4 miles an hour against the
current, the speed through the water being about 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles;
but this was, all things considered, a great success.</p>

<p>The experiment was successful, but it attracted little
attention, notwithstanding the fact that its success had
been witnessed by the committee of the Academy and by
many well-known savants and mechanics, and by officers on
Napoleon&#8217;s staff. The boat remained a long time on the
Seine, near the palace. The water-tube boiler of this vessel
(<a href="#Fig79">Fig. 79</a>) is still preserved at the Conservatoire des Arts et
M&eacute;tiers at Paris, where it is known as Barlow&#8217;s boiler. Barlow
patented it in France as early as 1793, as a steamboat-boiler,
and states that the object of his construction was to
obtain the greatest possible extent of heating-surface.</p>

<p>Fulton endeavored to secure the pecuniary aid and the
countenance of the First Consul, but in vain.</p>

<p>Livingston wrote home, describing the trial of this steamboat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and its results, and procured the passage of an act by
the Legislature of the State of New York, extending a
monopoly granted him in 1798 for the term of 20 years
from April 5, 1803, the date of the new law, and extending
the time allowed for proving the practicability of driving
a boat four miles an hour by steam to two years from the
same date. A later act further extended the time to April,
1807.</p>

<p>In May, 1804, Fulton went to England, giving up all
hope of success in France with either his steamboats or his
torpedoes. Fulton had already written to Boulton &amp; Watt,
ordering an engine to be built from plans which he furnished
them; but he had not informed them of the purpose
to which it was to be applied. This engine was to have a
steam-cylinder 2 feet in diameter and of 4 feet stroke. The
engine of the Charlotte Dundas was of very nearly the
same size; and this fact, and the visit of Fulton to Symmington
in 1801, as described by the latter, have been made
the basis of a claim that Fulton was a copyist of the plans
of others. The general accordance of the dimensions of
his boat on the Seine with those of the &#8220;Polacca&#8221; of Roosevelt
is also made the basis of similar claims by the friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of the latter. It would appear, however, that Symmington&#8217;s
statement is incorrect, as Fulton was in France, experimenting
with torpedoes, at the time (July, 1801<a name="FNanchor_79_79"
id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>) when
he is accused of having obtained from the English engineer
the dimensions and a statement of the performance of his
vessel. Yet a fireman employed by Symmington has made
an affidavit to the same statement. It is evident, however,
from what has preceded, that those inventors and builders
who were at that time working with the object of introducing
the steamboat were usually well acquainted with what
had been done by others, and with what was being done
by their contemporaries; and it is undoubtedly the fact
that each profited, so far as he was able, by the experience
of others.</p>

<p>While in England, however, Fulton was certainly not
so entirely absorbed in the torpedo experiments with which
he was occupied in the years 1804-&#8217;6 as to forget his plans
for a steamboat; and he saw the engine ordered by him in
1804 completed in the latter year, and preceded it to New
York, sailing from Falmouth in October, 1806, and reaching
the United States December 13, 1806.</p>

<p>The engine was soon received, and Fulton immediately
contracted for a hull in which to set it up. Meantime, Livingston
had also returned to the United States, and the two
enthusiasts worked together on a larger steamer than any
which had yet been constructed.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>&mdash;The Clermont, 1807.</p></div>

<p>In the spring of 1807, the &#8220;Clermont&#8221; (<a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>), as the
new boat was christened, was launched from the ship-yard of
Charles Brown, on the East River, New York. In August
the machinery was on board and in successful operation.
The hull of this boat was 133 feet long, 18 wide, and 9
deep. The boat soon made a trip to Albany, running the
distance of 150 miles in 32 hours running time, and returning
in 30 hours. The sails were not used on either occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the first voyage of considerable length ever
made by a steam-vessel; and Fulton, though not to be
classed with James Watt as an inventor, is entitled to the
great honor of having been the first to make steam-navigation
an every-day commercial success, and of having thus
made the first application of the steam-engine to ship-propulsion,
which was not followed by the retirement of the
experimenter from the field of his labors before success
was permanently insured.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span>&mdash;Engine of the Clermont, 1808.</p></div>

<p>The engine of the Clermont (<a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a>)
was of rather peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
form, the piston, <i>E</i>, being coupled to the crank-shaft,
<i>O</i>, by a bell-crank, <i>I H P</i>, and a connecting-rod, <i>P Q</i>, the
paddle-wheel shaft, <i>M N</i>, being separate from the crank-shaft,
and connected with the latter by gearing, <i>O O</i>. The
cylinders were 24 inches in diameter by 4 feet stroke. The
paddle-wheels had buckets 4 feet long, with a dip of 2 feet.
Old drawings, made by Fulton&#8217;s own hand, and showing
the engine as it was in 1808, and the engine of a later
steamer, the Chancellor Livingston, are in the lecture-room
of the author at the Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>The voyage of the Clermont to Albany was attended
by some ludicrous incidents, which found their counterparts
wherever, subsequently, steamers were for the first time
introduced. Mr. Colden, the biographer of Fulton, says
that she was described, by persons who had seen her passing
by night, &#8220;as a monster moving on the waters, defying
wind and tide, and breathing flames and smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>This first steamboat used dry pine wood for fuel, and
the flames rose to a considerable distance above the smoke-pipe.
When the fires were disturbed, mingled smoke and
sparks would rise high in the air. &#8220;This uncommon light,&#8221;
says Colden, &#8220;first attracted the attention of the crews of
other vessels. Notwithstanding the wind and tide were
averse to its approach, they saw with astonishment that it
was rapidly coming toward them; and when it came so
near that the noise of the machinery and paddles was
heard, the crews (if what was said in the newspapers of the
time be true), in some instances, shrank beneath their decks
from the terrific sight, and left their vessels to go on shore;
while others prostrated themselves, and besought Providence
to protect them from the approach of the horrible
monster which was marching on the tides, and lighting its
path by the fires which it vomited.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Clermont, Fulton used several of the now characteristic
features of the American river steamboat, and
subsequently introduced others. His most important and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
creditable work, aside from that of the introduction of the
steamboat into every-day use, was the experimental determination
of the magnitude and the laws of ship-resistance,
and the systematic proportioning of vessel and machinery
to the work to be done by them.</p>

<p>The success of the Clermont on the trial-trip was such
that Fulton soon after advertised the vessel as a regular
passenger-boat between New York and Albany.<a name="FNanchor_80_80"
id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>During the next winter the Clermont was repaired and
enlarged, and in the summer of 1808 was again on the
route to Albany; and, meantime, two new steamboats&mdash;the
Raritan and the Car of Neptune&mdash;had been built by Fulton.
In the year 1811 he built the Paragon. Both of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
two vessels last named were of nearly double the size of the
Clermont. A steam ferry-boat was built to ply between
New York and Jersey City in 1812, and the next year two
others, to connect the metropolis with Brooklyn. These
were &#8220;twin-boats,&#8221; the two parallel hulls being connected
by a &#8220;bridge&#8221; or deck common to both. The Jersey ferry
was crossed in fifteen minutes, the distance being a mile
and a half. To-day, the time occupied at the same ferry
is about ten minutes. Fulton&#8217;s ferry-boat carried, at one
load, 8 carriages, and about 30 horses, and still had room
for 300 or 400 foot-passengers. Fulton also designed steam-vessels
for use on the Western rivers, and, in 1815, some of
his boats were started as &#8220;packets&#8221; on the line between
New York and Providence, R. I.</p>

<p>Meantime, the War of 1812 was in progress, and Fulton
designed a steam vessel-of-war, which was then considered
a wonderfully formidable craft. His plans were submitted
to a commission of experienced naval officers, among whom
were Commodores Decatur and Perry, Captain John Paul
Jones, Captain Evans, and others whose names are still familiar,
and were favorably commended. Fulton proposed
to build a steam-vessel capable of carrying a heavy battery,
and of steaming four miles an hour. The ship was to be
fitted with furnaces for red-hot shot. Some of her guns
were to be discharged below the water-line. The estimated
cost was $320,000.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig82" id="Fig82"></a>
<img src="images/illo289.png" alt="Launch of the Fulton 1st" width="600" height="301" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span>&mdash;Launch of the &#8220;Fulton the First,&#8221; 1804.</p></div>

<p>The construction of the vessel was authorized by Congress
in March, 1814; the keel was laid June 20, 1814, and
the vessel was <a href="#Fig82">launched</a> October 29th of the same year.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Fulton the First,&#8221; as she was called, was considered
an enormous vessel at that time. The hull was double, 156
feet long, 56 feet wide, and 20 feet deep, measuring 2,475
tons. In the following May the ship was ready for her
engine, and in July was so far completed as to steam, on
a trial-trip, to the ocean at Sandy Hook and back&mdash;53 miles&mdash;in
8 hours and 20 minutes. In September of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
year, with armament and stores on board, the same route
was traversed again, the vessel making 5<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles an hour.
The vessel, as thus completed, had a double hull, each
about 20 feet longer than the Clermont, and separated by a
space 15 feet across. Her engine, having a steam-cylinder
48 inches in diameter and of 5 feet stroke of piston, was
furnished with steam by a copper boiler 22 feet long, 12
feet wide, and 8 feet high, and turned a wheel between the
two hulls which was 16 feet in diameter, and carried
&#8220;floats&#8221; or &#8220;buckets&#8221; 14 feet long, and with a dip of 4
feet. The engine was in one of the two hulls, and the
boiler in the other. The sides, at the gun-deck, were 4 feet
10 inches thick, and her spar-deck was surrounded by heavy
musket-proof bulwarks. The armament consisted of 30
32-pounders, which were intended to discharge red-hot
shot. There was one heavy mast for each hull, fitted with
large latteen sails. Each end of each hull was fitted with
a rudder. Large pumps were carried, which were intended
to throw heavy streams of water upon the decks of the enemy,
with a view to disabling the foe by wetting his ordnance
and ammunition. A submarine gun was to have
been carried at each bow, to discharge shot weighing 100
pounds, at a depth of 10 feet below the water-line.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>This was the first application of the steam-engine to
naval purposes, and, for the time, it was an exceedingly
creditable one. Fulton, however, did not live to see the
ship completed. He was engaged in a contest with Livingston,
who was then endeavoring to obtain permission
from the State of New Jersey to operate a line of steamboats
in the waters of the Hudson River and New York
Bay, and, while returning from attending a session of the
Legislature at Trenton, in January, 1815, was exposed to
the weather on the bay at a time when he was ill prepared
to withstand it. He was taken ill, and died February 24th of
that year. His death was mourned as a national calamity.</p>

<p>From the above brief sketch of this distinguished man
and his work, it is seen that, although Robert Fulton is not
entitled to distinction as an inventor, he was one of the
ablest, most persistent, and most successful of those who
have done so much for the world by the introduction of the
inventions of others. He was an intelligent engineer and
an enterprising business-man, whose skill, acuteness, and
energy have given the world the fruits of the inventive
genius of all who preceded him, and have thus justly
earned for him a fame that can never be lost.</p>

<p>Fulton had some active and enterprising rivals.</p>

<p>Oliver Evans had, in 1801 or 1802, sent one of his engines,
of about 150 horse-power, to New Orleans, for the
purpose of using it to propel a vessel owned by Messrs.
McKeever and Valcourt, which was there awaiting it. The
engine was actually set up in the boat, but at a low stage
of the river, and no trial could be made until the river
should again rise, some months later. Having no funds to
carry them through so long a period, Evans&#8217;s agents were
induced to remove the engine again, and to set it up in a
saw-mill, where it created great astonishment by its extraordinary
performance in sawing lumber.</p>

<p>Livingston and Roosevelt were also engaged in experiments
quite as early as Fulton, and perhaps earlier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>The prize gained by Fulton was, however, most closely
contested by Colonel <span class="smcap">John Stevens</span>, of Hoboken, who has
been <a href="#Stevens">already mentioned</a> in connection with the early history
of railroads, and who had been since 1791 engaged in
similar experiments. In 1789 he had petitioned the Legislature
of the State of New York for a grant similar to that
accorded to Livingston, and he then stated that his plans
were complete, and on paper.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span>&mdash;Section of Steam-Boiler, 1804.</p></div>

<p>In 1804, while Fulton was in Europe, Stevens had completed
a steamboat, 68 feet long and of 14 feet beam, which
combined novelties and merits of design in a manner that
exhibited the best possible evidence of remarkable inventive
talent, as well as of the most perfect appreciation of the
nature of the problem which he had proposed to himself to
solve. Its boiler (<a href="#Fig83">Fig. 83</a>) was of what is now known as the
water-tubular variety. It was quite similar to some now
known as sectional boilers, and contained 100 tubes 2 inches
in diameter and 18 inches long, each fastened at one end to
a central water-leg and steam-drum, and plugged at the
other end. The flames from the furnace passed around and
among the tubes, the water being inside them. The engine
(<a href="#Fig84">Fig. 84</a>) was a <i>direct-acting high-pressure</i> condensing engine,
having a 10-inch cylinder, 2 feet stroke of piston, and
drove a <i>screw</i> having four blades, and of a form which, even
to-day, appears quite good. The whole is a most remarkable
piece of early engineering.</p>

high-pressure condensing engine, with rotating valves, and
twin screw-propellers, as just described, is given a place of
honor in the model-room, or museum, where it contrasts
singularly with the mechanism contributed to the collection
by manufacturers and inventors of our own time. The hub

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>Stevens seems to have been the first to fully recognize
the importance of the principle involved in the construction
of the sectional steam-boiler. His eldest son, John Cox
Stevens, was in Great Britain in the year 1805, and, while
there, patented another modification of this type of boiler.
In his specification, he details both the method of construction
and the principles which determine its form. He says
that he describes this invention as it was made known to
him by his father, and adds:</p>

<p>&#8220;From a series of experiments made in France, in 1790,
by M. Belamour, under the auspices of the Royal Academy
of Sciences, it has been found that, within a certain range
the elasticity of steam is nearly doubled by every addition
of temperature equal to 30&deg; of Fahrenheit&#8217;s thermometer.
These experiments were carried no higher than 280&deg;, at
which temperature the elasticity of steam was found equal
to about four times the pressure of the atmosphere. By
experiments which have lately been made by myself, the
elasticity of steam at the temperature of boiling oil, which
has been estimated at about 600&deg;, was found to equal 40
times the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the discovery of this principle or law, which obtains
when water assumes a state of vapor, I certainly
can lay no claim; but to the application of it, upon certain
principles, to the improvement of the steam-engine, I do
claim exclusive right.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is obvious that, to derive advantage from an application
of this principle, it is absolutely necessary that
the vessel or vessels for generating steam should have
strength sufficient to withstand the great pressure from an
increase of elasticity in the steam; but this pressure is increased
or diminished in proportion to the capacity of the
containing vessel. The principle, then, of this invention
consists in forming a boiler by means of a system, or combination
of a number of small vessels, instead of using, as
in the usual mode, one large one; the relative strength of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the materials of which these vessels are composed increasing
in proportion to the diminution of capacity. It will
readily occur that there are an infinite variety of possible
modes of effecting such combinations; but, from the nature
of the case, there are certain limits beyond which it becomes
impracticable to carry on improvement. In the boiler I am
about to describe, I apprehend that the improvement is carried
to the utmost extent of which the principle is capable.
Suppose a plate of brass of one foot square, in which a
number of holes are perforated; into each of which holes is
fixed one end of a copper tube, of about an inch in diameter
and two feet long; and the other ends of these tubes
inserted in like manner into a similar piece of brass; the
tubes, to insure their tightness, to be cast in the plates;
these plates are to be inclosed at each end of the pipes by
a strong cap of cast-iron or brass, so as to leave a space of
an inch or two between the plates or ends of the pipes and
the cast-iron cap at each end; the caps at each end are to
be fastened by screw-bolts passing through them into the
plates; the necessary supply of water is to be injected by
means of a forcing-pump into the cap at one end, and
through a tube inserted into the cap at the other end the
steam is to be conveyed to the cylinder of the steam-engine;
the whole is then to be encircled in brickwork or masonry
in the usual manner, placed either horizontally or perpendicularly,
at option.</p>

<p>&#8220;I conceive that the boiler above described embraces
the most eligible mode of applying the principle before
mentioned, and that it is unnecessary to give descriptions
of the variations in form and construction that may be
adopted, especially as these forms may be diversified in
many different modes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boilers of the character of those described in the specification
given above were used on the locomotive built by
John Stevens in 1824-&#8217;25, and one of them remains in the
collections of the Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>The use of such a boiler 70 years ago is even more remarkable
than the adoption of the screw-propeller, in such
excellent proportions, 30 years before the labors of Smith
and of Ericsson brought the screw into general use; and
we have, in this strikingly original combination, as good
evidence of the existence of unusual engineering talent in
this great engineer as we found of his political and statesmanlike
ability in his efforts to forward the introduction of
railways.</p>

<p>Colonel John Stevens designed a peculiar form of iron-clad
in the year 1812, which has been since reproduced by
no less distinguished and successful an engineer than the
late John Elder, of Glasgow, Scotland. It consisted of a
saucer-shaped hull, carrying a heavy battery, and plated
with iron of ample thickness to resist the shot fired from
the heaviest ordnance then known. This vessel was secured
to a swivel, and was anchored in the channel to be defended.
A set of screw-propellers, driven by steam-engines, and situated
beneath the vessel, where they were safe against
injury by shot, were so arranged as to permit the vessel to
be rapidly revolved about its centre. As each gun was
brought into line of fire, it was discharged, and was then
reloaded before coming around again. This was probably
the earliest embodiment of the now well-established &#8220;Monitor&#8221;
principle. It was probably the first iron-clad ever
designed. It has recently been again brought out and introduced
into the Russian navy, and is there called the
&#8220;Popoffka.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first of Stevens&#8217;s boats performed so well, that he
immediately built another one, using the same engine as
before, but employing a larger boiler, and propelling the
vessel by <i>twin screws</i>, the latter being another instance of
his use of a device brought forward long afterward as new,
and frequently adopted. This boat was sufficiently successful
to prove the practicability of making steam-navigation a
commercial success; and Stevens, assisted by his sons, built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
a boat which he named the &#8220;Ph&oelig;nix,&#8221; and made the first
trial in 1807, but just too late to anticipate Fulton. This
boat was driven by paddle-wheels.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig86" id="Fig86"></a>
<img src="images/illo296.png" alt="Stevens's Twin-Screw Steamer" width="500" height="278" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.</span>&mdash;Stevens&#8217;s Twin-Screw Steamer, 1805.</p></div>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nix, being shut out of the waters of the State
of New York by the monopoly held by Fulton and Livingston,
was used for a time between New York and New
Brunswick, and then, anticipating a better pecuniary return,
it was concluded to send her to Philadelphia, to ply on the
Delaware.</p>

<p>At that time no canal offered the opportunity to make
an inland passage; and in June, 1808, Robert L. Stevens,
a son of John, started with her to make the passage by sea.
Although meeting a gale of wind, he arrived at Philadelphia
safely, having been the first to trust himself on the
open sea in a vessel relying entirely upon steam-power.</p>

<p>From this time forward the Stevenses, father and sons,
continued to construct steam-vessels; and, after the breaking
down of the Fulton monopoly by the courts, they built
the most successful steamboats that ran on the Hudson
River.</p>

<p>After Fulton and Stevens had thus led the way, steam-navigation
was introduced very rapidly on both sides of the
ocean; and on the Mississippi the number of boats set afloat
was soon large enough to fulfill Evans&#8217;s prediction that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
navigation of that river would ultimately be effected by
steam-vessels.</p>

<p>The changes and improvements which, during the 20
years succeeding the time of Fulton and of John Stevens,
gradually led to the adoption of the now recognized type
of &#8220;American river-boat&#8221; and its steam-engine, were principally
made by that son of the senior Stevens, who has
already been mentioned&mdash;<span class="smcap"><a href="#Port11">Robert L. Stevens</a></span>&mdash;and who
became known later as the designer and builder of the first
well-planned iron-clad ever constructed, the Stevens Battery.
Much of his best work was done during his father&#8217;s
lifetime.</p>

<p>He made many extended and most valuable, as well
as interesting, experiments on ship-propulsion, expending
much time and large sums of money upon them; and many
years before they became generally understood, he had arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
at a knowledge not only of the laws governing the
variation of resistance at excessive speeds, but he had determined,
and had introduced into his practice, those forms
of least resistance and those graceful water-lines which have
only recently distinguished the practice of other successful
naval architects.</p>

<p>Referring to his invaluable services, President King,
who seems to have been the first to thoroughly appreciate
the immense amount of original invention and the surprising
excellence of the engineering of this family, in a lecture
delivered in New York in 1851, gave, for the first time, a
connected and probably accurate description of their work,
upon which nearly all later accounts have been based.</p>

<p>Young Stevens began working in his father&#8217;s machine-shop
in 1804 or 1805, when a mere boy, and thus acquired
at a very early age that familiarity with practical details of
work and of business which is essential to perfect success.
It was he who introduced the now common &#8220;hollow water-line&#8221;
in the Ph&oelig;nix, and thus anticipated the claims of the
builders of the once famous &#8220;Baltimore clippers,&#8221; and of
the inventors of the &#8220;wave-line&#8221; form of vessels. In the
same vessel he adopted a feathering paddle-wheel and the
guard-beam now universally seen in our river steamboats.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>&mdash;The Feathering Paddle-Wheel.</p></div>

<p>As usually constructed, this arrangement of float is as
shown in <a href="#Fig87">Fig. 87</a>. The rods, <i>F F</i>, connect the eccentrically-set
collar, <i>G</i>, carried on <i>H</i>, a pin mounted on the paddle-beam
outside the wheel, or an eccentric secured to the
vessel, with the short arms, <i>D D</i>, by which the paddles are
turned upon the pins, <i>E E</i>. <i>A</i> is the centre of the paddle-wheel,
and <i>C C</i> are arms. Circular hoops, or bands, connect
all of the arms, each of which carries a float. They
are all thus tied together, forming a very firm and powerful
combination to resist external forces.</p>

<p>The steamboat Philadelphia was built in the year 1813,
and the young naval architect took advantage of the opportunity
to introduce several new devices, including screw-bolts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
in place of tree-nails, and diagonal knees of wood and
of iron. Two years later he altered the engines of this boat,
and arranged them to work steam expansively. A little
later he commenced using anthracite coal, which had been
discovered in 1791 by Philip Ginter, and introduced at
Wilkesbarre, Pa., in the smith-shops, some years before the
Revolution. It had been used in a peculiar grate devised by
Judge Fell, of that town, in 1808. Oliver Evans also had
used it in stoves even earlier than the latter date, and at
about the same time it had been used in the blast-furnace<a name="FNanchor_81_81"
id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
at Kingston. Stevens was the first of whom we have record
who was thoroughly successful in using, as a steam-coal,
the new and almost unmanageable fuel. He fitted up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
boiler of the steamboat Passaic for it in 1818, and adopted
anthracite as a steaming-coal. He used it in a cupola-furnace
in the same year, and its use then rapidly became general
in the Eastern States.</p>

<p>Stevens continued his work of improving the beam-engine
for many years. He designed the now universally-used
&#8220;skeleton-beam,&#8221; which is one of the characteristic features
of the American engine, and placed the first example of this
light and elegant, yet strong, construction on the steamer
Hoboken in the year 1822. He built the Trenton, which was
then considered an extraordinarily powerful, fast, and handsome
vessel, two years afterward, and placed the two boilers
on the guards&mdash;a custom which is still general on the river
steamboats of the Eastern States. In this vessel he also
adopted the plan of making the paddle-wheel floats in two
parts, placing one above the other, and securing the upper
half on the forward and the lower half on the after side of
the arm, thus obtaining a smoother action of the wheel,
and less loss by oblique pressures.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig88" id="Fig88"></a>
<img src="images/illo301.png" alt="The North America and The Albany" width="585" height="269" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>&mdash;The North America and Albany, 1827-&#8217;30.</p></div>

<p>In 1827 he built the North America (<a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>), one of
his largest and most successful steamers, a vessel fitted with
a pair of engines each 44<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter of cylinder
and 8 feet stroke of piston, making 24 revolutions per minute,
driving the boat 15 to 16 miles an hour. Anticipating
difficulty in keeping the long, light, shallow vessel in shape
when irregularly laden, and when steaming at the high
speed expected to be obtained when her powerful engine
was exerting its maximum effort, he adopted the expedient
of stiffening the hull by means of a truss of simple form.
This proved thoroughly satisfactory, and the &#8220;hog-frame,&#8221;
as it has since been inelegantly but universally called, is
still one of the peculiar features of every American river-steamer
of any considerable size. It was in the North
America, also, that he first introduced the artificial blast
for forcing the fires, which is still another detail of now
usual practice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Stevens next turned his attention to the engine again,
and adopted spring bearings under the paddle-shaft of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
New Philadelphia in 1828, and fitted the steam-cylinder
with the &#8220;double-poppet&#8221; valve, which is now universally
used on beam-engines. This consists of two disk-valves,
connected by the valve-spindle. The disks are of unequal
sizes, the smaller passing through the seat of the larger.
When seated, the pressure of the steam is, in the steam-valve,
taken on the upper side of the larger and the lower
side of the smaller disk, thus producing a partial balancing
of the valve, and rendering it easy to work the heaviest engine
by the hand-gear. The two valve-seats are formed in
the top and the bottom, respectively, of the steam-passage
leading to the cylinder; and when the valve is raised, the
steam enters at the top and the bottom at the same time,
and the two currents, uniting, flow together into the steam-cylinder.
The same form of valve is used as an exhaust-valve.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig89" id="Fig89"></a>
<img src="images/illo302.png" alt="Stevens's Return Tubular Boiler" width="391" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span>&mdash;Stevens&#8217;s Return Tubular Boiler, 1832.</p></div>

<p>At about the same time he built the now standard form
of return tubular boilers for moderate pressures. In the
<a href="#Fig89">figure</a>, <i>S</i> is the steam and <i>W</i> the water space, and <i>F</i> the
furnace. The direction of the currents of smoke and gas
are shown by the arrows.</p>

<p>Some years later (1840), Stevens commenced using
steam-packed pistons on the Trenton, in which steam was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
admitted by self-adjusting valves behind the metallic packing-rings,
setting them out more effectively than did the
steel springs then (and still) usually employed.</p>

<p>His pistons, thus fitted, worked well for many years. A
set of the small brass check-valves used in a piston of this
kind, built by Stevens, and preserved in the cabinets of the
Stevens Institute of Technology, are good evidence of the
ingenuity and excellent workmanship which distinguished
the machinery constructed under the direction of this great
engineer.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="Fig90" id="Fig90"></a>
<img src="images/illo303.png" alt="Stevens's Valve-Motion" width="300" height="271" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>&mdash;Stevens&#8217;s Valve-Motion.</p></div>

<p>The now familiar &#8220;Stevens cut-off,&#8221; a peculiar device
for securing the expansion of steam in the steam-cylinder,
was the invention (1841) of Robert L. Stevens and a nephew,
who inherited the same constructive talent which distinguished
the first of these great men&mdash;Mr. Francis B. Stevens.
In this form of valve-gear, the steam and exhaust
valves are independently worked by separate eccentrics, the
latter being set in the usual manner, opening and closing
the exhaust-passages just before the crank passes its centre.
The steam-eccentric is so placed that the steam-valve is
opened as usual, but closed when but about one-half the
stroke has been made. This result is accomplished by giving
the eccentric a greater throw than
is required by the motion of the valve,
and permitting it to move through a
portion of its path without moving the
valve. Thus, in <a href="#Fig90">Fig. 90</a>, if <i>A B</i> be the
direction of motion of the eccentric-rod,
the valve would ordinarily open
the steam-port when the eccentric assumes
the position <i>O C</i>, closing when
the eccentric has passed around to <i>O D</i>. With the Stevens
valve-gear, the valve is opened when the eccentric reaches
<i>O E</i>, and closes when it arrives at <i>O F</i>. The steam-valve
of the opposite end of the cylinder is open while the eccentric
is moving from <i>O M</i> to <i>O K</i>. Between <i>K</i> and <i>E</i>,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
between <i>F</i> and <i>M</i>, both valves are seated. <i>H B</i> is proportional
to the lift of the valve, and <i>O H</i> to the motion of
the valve-gear when out of contact with the valve-lifters.
While the crank is moving through an arc, <i>E F</i>, steam is
entering the cylinder; from <i>F</i> to <i>M</i> the steam is expanding.
At <i>M</i> the stroke is completed, and the other steam-valve
opens. The ratio <span class="enum">E M</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">E L</span> is the ratio of expansion.</p>

<p>This form of cut-off motion is still a very usual one,
and can be seen in nearly all steamers in the United States
not using the device of Sickles. It was at about this time,
also, that Stevens, having succeeded his father in the business
of introducing the steam-engine in land-transportation,
as well as on the water, adopted the use of steam expansively
on the locomotives of the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad,
which was controlled and built by capital furnished principally
by the Messrs. Stevens. He at the same time constructed
eight-wheeled engines for heavy work, and adopted
anthracite coal as fuel. In the latter change he was thoroughly
successful, and the same improvement was made
with engines built for fast traffic in 1848.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of all the applications of steam-power
proposed by Robert L. Stevens was that known as
the Stevens Steam Iron-Clad Battery. As has already been
stated, Colonel John Stevens had proposed, as early as 1812,
to build a circular or saucer-shaped iron-clad, like those
built 60 years later for the Russian Navy. Nothing was
done, however, although the son revived the idea in a modified
form 20 years afterward. In the years 1813-&#8217;14, the
war with England being then in progress, he invented,
after numerous and hazardous experiments, an <i>elongated
shell</i>, to be fired from ordinary smooth-bored cannon. Having
perfected this invention, he sold the secret to the
United States, after making experiments to prove their destructiveness
so decisive as to leave no doubt of the efficacy
of such projectiles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>As early as 1837 he had perfected a plan of an iron-clad
war-vessel, and in August, 1841, his brothers, James C. and
Edwin A. Stevens, representing Robert L., addressed a
letter to the Secretary of the Navy, proposing to build an
iron-clad vessel of high speed, with all its machinery below
the water-line, and having submerged screw-propellers.
The armament was to consist of the most powerful rifled
guns, loading at the breech, and provided with elongated
shot and shell. In the year 1842, having contracted to build
for the United States Government a large war-steamer on
this plan, which should be shot and shell proof, Robert L.
Stevens built a steamboat at Bordentown, for the sole purpose
of experimenting on the forms and curves of propeller-blades,
as compared with side-wheels, and continued his experiments
for many months. After some delay, during
which Mr. Stevens and his brothers were engaged with their
experiments and in perfecting their plans, the keel of an
iron-clad was laid down in a dry-dock which had been constructed
for the purpose at great cost. This vessel was to
have been 250 feet long, of 40 feet beam, and 28 feet deep.
The machinery was designed to furnish 700 indicated horse-power.
The plating was proposed to be 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches thick&mdash;the
same thickness of armor as was adopted 10 years later
by the French for their comparatively rude constructions.</p>

<p>In 1854, such marked progress had been made in the
construction of ordnance that Mr. Stevens was no longer
willing to proceed with the original plans, fearing that,
were the ship completed, it might prove not invulnerable,
and might throw some discredit upon its designer, as well
as upon the navy of which it was to form a part. The
work, which had, in those years of peace, progressed very
slowly and intermittently, was therefore stopped entirely,
the vessel given up, and in 1854 the keel of a ship of vastly
greater size and power was laid down. The new design
was 415 feet long, of 45 feet beam, and of something over
5,000 tons displacement. The thickness of armor proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
was 6<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>
inches&mdash;2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> inches thicker than that of the first
French and British iron-clads&mdash;and the machinery was designed
by Mr. Stevens to be of 8,624 indicated horse-power,
driving twin-screws, and propelling the vessel 20 miles or
more an hour. As with the preceding design, the progress
of construction was intermittent and very slow. Government
advanced funds, and then refused to continue the
work; successive administrations alternately encouraged
and discouraged the engineer; and he finally, cutting loose
entirely from all official connections, went on with the work
at his own expense.</p>

<p>The remarkable genius of the elder Stevens was well
reflected in the character of his son, and is in no way better
exemplified than by the accuracy with which, in this great
ship, those forms and proportions, both of hull and machinery,
were adopted which are now, twenty-five years later,
recognized as most correct under similar conditions. The
lines of the vessel are beautifully fair and fine, and are what
J. Scott Russell has called &#8220;wave-lines,&#8221; or trochoidal lines,
such as Rankine has shown to be the best possible for easy
propulsion. The proportion of length to midship dimensions
is such as to secure the speed proposed with a minimum
resistance, and to accord closely with the proportions
arrived at and adopted by common consent in present
transoceanic navigation by the best&mdash;not to say radical&mdash;builders.</p>

<p>The death of Robert L. Stevens occurred in April, 1856,
when this larger vessel had advanced so far toward completion
that the hull and machinery were practically finished,
and it only remained to add the armor-plating, and to decide
upon the form of fighting-house and upon the number
and size of guns. The construction of the vessel, which had
proceeded slowly and intermittently during the years of
peace, as successive administrations had considered it necessary
to continue the payment of appropriations, or had
stopped temporarily in the absence of any apparent immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
necessity for continuance of the work, was again interrupted
by his death.</p>

<p>The name of Robert L. Stevens will be long remembered
as that of one of the greatest of American mechanics, the
most intelligent of naval architects, and as the first, and
one of the greatest, of those to whom we are indebted for
the commencement of the mightiest of revolutions in the
methods and implements of modern naval warfare. American
mechanical genius and engineering skill have rarely
been too promptly recognized, and no excuse will be required
for an attempt (which it is hoped may yet be made)
to place such splendid work as that of the Messrs. Stevens
in a light which shall reveal both its variety and extent and
its immense importance.</p>

<p>While Fulton was introducing the steamboat upon the
waters of New York Bay and the Hudson River, and while
the Stevenses, father and sons, were rapidly bringing out a
fleet of steamers on the Delaware River and Bay, other
mechanics were preparing to contest the field with them as
opportunity offered, and as legislative acts authorizing monopoly
expired by limitation or were repealed.</p>

<p>About 1821, Robert L. Thurston, John Babcock, and
Captain Stephen T. Northam, of Newport, R. I., commenced
building steamboats, beginning with a small craft
intended for use at Slade&#8217;s Ferry, on an arm of Narragansett
Bay, near Fall River. They afterward built vessels to
ply on Long Island Sound. One of their earliest boats was
the Babcock, built at Newport in 1826. The engine was
built by Thurston and Babcock, at Portsmouth, R. I.
They were assisted in their work by Richard Sanford, and
with funds by Northam. The engine was of 10 or 12
inches diameter of cylinder, and 3 or 4 feet stroke of piston.
The boiler was a form of &#8220;pipe-boiler,&#8221; subsequently
(1824) patented by Babcock. The water used was injected
into the hot boiler as fast as required to furnish steam, no
water being retained in the steam-generator. This boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
was succeeded, in 1827-&#8217;28, by a larger vessel, the Rushlight,
for which the engine was built by James P. Allaire,
at New York, while the boat was built at Newport. The
boilers of both vessels had tubes of cast-iron. The smaller
of these boats was of 80 tons burden; it steamed from
Newport to Providence, 30 miles, in 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> hours, and to New
York, a distance of 175 miles, in 25 hours, using 1<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> cord
of wood.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Thurston and Babcock subsequently removed
to Providence, where the latter soon died. Thurston continued
to build steam-engines at this place until nearly a
half-century later, dying in 1874.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a
href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The establishment
founded by him, after various changes, became the Providence
Steam-Engine Works.</p>

<p>James P. Allaire, of New York, the West Point Iron
Foundery, at West Point, on the Hudson River, and Daniel
Copeland and his son, Charles W. Copeland, on the
Connecticut River, were also early builders of engines for
steam-vessels. Daniel Copeland was probably the first
(1850) to adopt a slide-valve working with a lap to secure
the expansion of steam. His steamboats were then usually
stern-wheel vessels, and were built to ply on several routes
on the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound. The
son, Charles W. Copeland, went to West Point, and while
there designed some heavy marine steam-machinery, and
subsequently designed several steam vessels-of-war for the
United States Navy. He was the earliest designer of iron
steamers in the United States, building the Siamese in 1838.
This steamer was intended for use on Lake Pontchartrain
and the canal to New Orleans. It had two hulls, was 110
feet long, and drew but 22 inches of water, loaded. The
two horizontal non-condensing engines turned a single
paddle-wheel placed between the two hulls, driving the
boat 10 miles an hour. The hull was constructed of plates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of iron 10 feet long, formed on blocks after having been
heated in a furnace constructed especially for the purpose.
The frames were of T-iron, which was probably here used
for the first time. The same engineer, associated with Samuel
Hart, a well-known naval constructor, built, in 1841, for
the United States Navy, the iron steamer Michigan, a war-vessel
intended for service on the great northern lakes.
This vessel is still in service, and in good order. The hull
is 162<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in length, 27 feet in breadth,
and 12<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in
depth, measuring 500 tons. The frames were made of
T-iron, stiffened by reverse bars of L-iron. The keel-plate
was <span class="enum">5</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span> inch thick, the bottom plates
<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span>, and the sides
<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">16</span> inch.
The deck-beams were of iron, and the vessel, as a whole,
was a good specimen of iron-ship building.</p>

<p>During the period from 1830 to 1840, a considerable
number of the now standard details of steam-engine and
steamboat construction were devised or introduced by Copeland.
He was probably the first to use (on the Fulton, 1840)
an independent engine to drive the blowing-fans where an
artificial draught was required. He made a practice of
fitting his steamers with a &#8220;bilge-injection,&#8221; by means of
which the vessel could be freed of water, through the condenser
and air-pump, when leaking seriously; the condensing-water
is, in such a case, taken from inside the vessel,
instead of from the sea. This is probably an American device.
It was in use in the United States previously to 1835,
as was the use of anthracite coal on steamers, which was continued
by Copeland in manufacturing and in air-furnaces, as
well as on steamboats. He also modified the form of Stevens&#8217;s
double-poppet valve, giving it such shape that it was comparatively
easy to grind it tight and to keep it in order.</p>

<p>In 1825, James P. Allaire, of New York, built compound
engines for the Henry Eckford, and subsequently
constructed similar engines for several other steamers, one
of which, the Sun, made the trip from New York to Albany
in 12 hours 18 minutes. He used steam at 100 pounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
pressure. Erastus W. Smith afterward introduced this
form of engine on the Great Lakes, and still later they were
introduced into British steamers. The machinery of the
steamer Buckeye State was constructed at the Allaire
Works, New York, in 1850, from the designs of John
Baird and Erastus W. Smith, the latter being the designing
and constructing engineer. The steamer was placed
on the route between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit, in
1851, and gave most satisfactory results, consuming less
than two-thirds the fuel required by a similar vessel of the
same line fitted with the single-cylinder engine. The steam-cylinders
of this engine were placed one within the other,
the low-pressure exterior cylinder being annular. They
were 37 and 80 inches in diameter respectively, and the
stroke was 11 feet. Both pistons were connected to one
cross-head, and the general arrangement of the engine was
similar to that of the common form of beam-engine. The
steam-pressure was from 70 to 75 pounds&mdash;about the maximum
pressure adopted a quarter of a century later on transatlantic
lines. This steamer was of high speed, as well as
economical of fuel.</p>

<p>In the year 1830, there were 86 steamers on the Hudson
River and in Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>During the early part of the nineteenth century, the
introduction of the steamboat upon the waters of the great
rivers of the interior of the United States was one of the
most notable details of its history. Inaugurated by the
unsuccessful experiment of Evans, the building of steamboats
on those waters, once commenced, never ceased; and
a generation after Fitch&#8217;s burial on the shore of the Ohio,
his last wish&mdash;that he might lie &#8220;where the song of the
boatman would enliven the stillness of his resting-place, and
the music of the steam-engine soothe his spirit&#8221;&mdash;was fulfilled
day by day unceasingly.</p>

<p>Nicholas J. Roosevelt was, as has been already stated,
the first to take a steamboat down the great rivers. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
boat was built at Pittsburgh in 1811, under an arrangement
with Fulton and Livingston, from Fulton&#8217;s plans. It was
called the &#8220;New Orleans,&#8221; was of about 200 tons burden,
and was propelled by a stern-wheel, assisted, when the
winds were favorable, by sails carried on two masts. The
hull was 138 feet long, 30 feet beam, and the cost of the
whole, including engines, was about $40,000. The builder,
with his family, an engineer, a pilot, and six &#8220;deck-hands,&#8221;
left Pittsburgh in October, 1811, reaching Louisville in 70
hours (steaming about 10 miles an hour), and New Orleans
in 14 days, steaming from Natchez.</p>

<p>The next steamers built on Western waters were probably
the Comet and the Vesuvius, both of which were in
service some time. The Comet was finally laid aside, and
the engine used to drive a mill, and the Vesuvius was destroyed
by the explosion of her boilers. As early as 1813
there were two shops at Pittsburgh building steam-engines.
Steamboat-building now became an important and lucrative
business in the West; and it is stated that as early as 1840
there were a thousand steamers on the Mississippi and its
tributaries.</p>

<p>In the Washington, built at Wheeling, Va., in 1816,
under the direction of Captain Henry M. Shreve, the boilers,
which had previously been placed in the hold, were
carried on the main-deck, and a &#8220;hurricane-deck&#8221; was
built over them. Shreve substituted two horizontal direct-acting
engines for the single upright engine used by Fulton,
drove them by high-pressure steam without condensation,
and attached them, one on each side the boat, to
cranks placed at right angles. He adopted a cam cut-off
expanding the steam considerably, and the flue-boiler of
Evans. At that time the voyage from New Orleans to
Louisville occupied three weeks, and Shreve was made the
subject of many witticisms when he predicted that the time
would ultimately be shortened to ten days. It is now made
in four days. The Washington was seized at New Orleans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in 1817, by order of Livingston, who claimed that his rights
included the monopoly of the navigation of the Mississippi
and its tributaries. The courts decided adversely on this
claim, and the release of the Washington was the act which
removed every obstacle to the introduction of steam-navigation
throughout the United States.</p>

<p>The first steamer on the Great Lakes was the Ontario,
built in 1816, at Sackett&#8217;s Harbor. Fifteen years later,
Western steamboats had taken the peculiar form which has
since usually distinguished them.</p>

<p>The use of the steam-engine for ocean-navigation kept
pace with its introduction on inland waters. Begun by
Robert L. Stevens in the United States, in the year 1808,
and by his contemporaries, Bell and Dodd, in Great Britain,
it steadily and rapidly advanced in effectiveness and importance,
and has now nearly driven the sailing fleet from the
ocean. Transatlantic steam-navigation began with the voyage
of the American steamer Savannah from Savannah, Ga.,
to St. Petersburg, Russia, <i>via</i> Great Britain and the North-European
ports, in the year 1819. Fulton, not long before
his death, planned a vessel, which it was proposed to place
in service in the Baltic Sea; but circumstances compelled a
change of plan finally, and the steamer was placed on a
line between Newport, R. I., and the city of New York;
and the Savannah, several years later, made the voyage then
proposed for Fulton&#8217;s ship. The Savannah measured 350
tons, and was constructed by Crocker &amp; Fickett, at Corlears
Hook, N. Y. She was purchased by Mr. Scarborough, of
Savannah, who placed Captain Moses Rogers, previously in
command of the Clermont and of Stevens&#8217;s boat, the Ph&oelig;nix,
in charge. The ship was fitted with steam-machinery
and paddle-wheels, and sailed for Savannah April 27, 1819,
making the voyage successfully in seven days. From Savannah,
the vessel sailed for Liverpool May 26th, and arrived
at that port June 20th. During this trip the engines
were used 18 days, and the remainder of the voyage was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
made under sail. From Liverpool the Savannah sailed,
July 23d, for the Baltic, touching at Copenhagen, Stockholm,
St. Petersburg, and other ports. At St. Petersburg,
Lord Lyndock, who had been a passenger, was landed; and,
on taking leave of the commander of the steamer, the distinguished
guest presented him with a silver tea-kettle, suitably
inscribed with a legend referring to the importance of
the event which afforded him the opportunity. The Savannah
left St. Petersburg in November, passing New York
December 9th, and reaching Savannah in 50 days from the
date of departure, stopping four days at Copenhagen, Denmark,
and an equal length of time at Arundel, Norway.
Several severe gales were met in the Atlantic, but no serious
injury was done to the ship.</p>

<p>The Savannah was a full-rigged ship. The wheels
were turned by an inclined direct-acting low-pressure engine,
having a steam-cylinder 40 inches in diameter and 6
feet stroke of piston. The paddle-wheels were of wrought-iron,
and were so attached that they could be detached and
hoisted on board when it was desired. After the return of
the ship to the United States, the machinery was removed
and was sold to the Allaire Works, of New York. The
steam-cylinder was exhibited by the purchasers at the
&#8220;World&#8217;s Fair&#8221; at New York thirty years later. The vessel
was employed, as a sailing-vessel, on a line between
New York and Savannah, and was finally lost in the year
1822. Under sail, with a moderate breeze, this ship is said
to have sailed about three knots, and to have steamed five
knots. Pine-wood was used as the fuel, which fact accounts
for the necessity of making the transatlantic voyage partly
under sail.</p>

<p>Renwick states that another vessel, ship-rigged and
fitted with a steam-engine, was built at New York in 1819,
to ply between New York and Charleston, and to New Orleans
and Havana, and that it proved perfectly successful
as a steamer, having good speed, and proving an excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sea-boat. The enterprise was, however, pecuniarily a failure,
and the vessel was sold to the Brazilian Government
after the removal of the engine. In 1825 the steamer Enterprise
made a voyage to India, sailing and steaming as
the weather and the supply of fuel permitted. The voyage
occupied 47 days.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these successful passages across the
ocean, and the complete success of the steamboat in rivers
and harbors, it was asserted, as late as 1838, by many who
were regarded as authority, that the passage of the ocean
by steamers was quite impracticable, unless possibly they
could steam from the coasts of Europe to Newfoundland or
to the Azores, and, replenishing their coal-bunkers, resume
their voyages to the larger American ports. The voyage
was, however, actually accomplished by two steamers in
the year just mentioned. These were the Sirius, a ship of
700 tons and of 250 horse-power, and the Great Western,
of 1,340 tons and 450 horse-power. The latter was built
for this service, and was a large ship for that time, measuring
236 feet in length. Her wheels were 28 feet in diameter,
and 10 feet in breadth of face. The Sirius sailed from
Cork April 4, 1838, and the Great Western from Bristol
April 8th, both arriving at New York on the same day&mdash;April
23d&mdash;the Sirius in the morning, and the Great Western
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Great Western carried out of Bristol 660 tons of
coal. Seven passengers chose to take advantage of the opportunity,
and made the voyage in one-half the time usually
occupied by the sailing-packets of that day. Throughout
the voyage the wind and sea were nearly ahead, and
the two vessels pursued the same course, under very similar
conditions. Arriving at New York, they were received
with the greatest possible enthusiasm. They were saluted
by the forts and the men-of-war in the harbor; the merchant-vessels
dipped their flags, and the citizens assembled
on the Battery, and, coming to meet them in boats of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
kinds and sizes, cheered heartily. The newspapers of the
time were filled with the story of the voyage and with descriptions
of the steamers themselves and of their machinery.</p>

<p>A few days later the two steamers started on their return
to Great Britain, the Sirius reaching Falmouth safely
in 18 days, and the Great Western making the voyage to
Bristol in 15 days, the latter meeting with head-winds and
working, during a part of the time, against a heavy gale
and in a high sea, at the rate of but two knots an hour. The
Sirius was thought too small for this long and boisterous
route, and was withdrawn and replaced on the line between
London and Cork, where the ship had previously been employed.
The Great Western continued several years in
the transatlantic trade.</p>

<p>Thus these two voyages inaugurated a transoceanic
steam-service, which has steadily grown in extent and in
importance. The use of steam-power for this work of extended
ocean-transportation has never since been interrupted.
During the succeeding six years the Great Western
made 70 passages across the Atlantic, occupying on the
voyages to the westward an average of 15<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> days, and eastward
13<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>. The quickest passage to New York was made
in May, 1843, in 12 days and 18 hours, and the fastest
steaming was logged 12 months earlier, when the voyage
from New York was made in 12 days and 7 hours.</p>

<p>Meantime, several other steamers were built and placed
in the transatlantic trade. Among these were the Royal
William, the British Queen, the President, the Liverpool,
and the Great Britain. The latter, the finest of the fleet,
was launched in 1843. This steamer was 300 feet long, 50
feet beam, and of 1,000 horse-power. The hull was of iron,
and the whole ship was an example of the very best work
of that time. After several voyages, this vessel went
ashore on the coast of Ireland, and there remained several
weeks, but was finally got off, without having suffered serious
injury&mdash;a remarkable illustration of the stanchness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of an iron hull when well built and of good material. The
vessel was repaired, and many years afterward was still
afloat, and engaged in the transportation of passengers and
merchandise to Australia.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Cunard Line&#8221; of transatlantic steamers was established
in the year 1840. The first of the line&mdash;the Britannia&mdash;sailed
from Liverpool for New York, July 4th of
that year, and was followed, on regular sailing-days, by the
other three of the four ships with which the company commenced
business. These four vessels had an aggregate tonnage
of 4,600 tons, and their speed was less than eight
knots. To-day, the tonnage of a single vessel of the fleet
exceeds that of the four; the total tonnage has risen to
many times that above given. There are 50 steamers in
the line, aggregating nearly 50,000 horse-power. The
speed of the steamships of the present time is double that
of the vessels of that date, and passages are not infrequently
made in eight days.</p>

<p>The form of steam-engine in most general use at this
time, on transatlantic steamers, was that known as the
&#8220;side-lever engine.&#8221; It was first given the standard form
by Messrs. Maudsley &amp; Co., of London, about 1835, and
was built by them for steamers supplied to the British Government
for general mail service.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;The Atlantic, 1851.</p></div>

<p>The steam-vessels of the time are well represented in
the accompanying engraving (<a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>) of the steamship
Atlantic&mdash;a vessel which was shortly afterward (1851) built
as the pioneer steamer of the American &#8220;Collins Line.&#8221;
This steamship was one of several which formed the earliest
of American steamship-lines, and is one of the finest examples
of the type of paddle-steamers which was finally superseded
by the later screw-fleets. The &#8220;Collins Line&#8221; existed
but a very few years, and its failure was probably determined
as much by the evident and inevitable success of
screw-propulsion as by the difficulty of securing ample capital,
complete organization, and efficient general management.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
This steamer was built at New York&mdash;the hull
by William Brown, and the machinery by the Novelty
Iron-Works. The length of the hull was 276 feet, its
breadth 45 feet, and the depth of hold 31<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet. The
width over the paddle-boxes was 75 feet. The ship measured
2,860 tons. The form of the hull was then peculiar
in the fineness of its lines; the bow was sharp, and the
stern fine and smooth, and the general outline such as best
adapted the ship for high speed. The main saloon was
about 70 feet long, and the dining-room was 60 feet in
length and 20 feet wide. The state-rooms were arranged
on each side the dining &#8220;saloon,&#8221; and accommodated 150
passengers. These vessels were beautifully fitted up, and
with them was inaugurated that wonderful system of passenger-transportation
which has since always been distinguished
by those comforts and conveniences which the
American traveler has learned to consider his by right.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>&mdash;The Side-Lever Engine, 1849.</p></div>

<p>The machinery of these ships was, for that time, remarkably
powerful and efficient. The engines were of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
side-lever type, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig92">Fig. 92</a>, which represents
the engine of the Pacific, designed by Mr. Charles W.
Copeland, and built by the Allaire Works.</p>

<p>In this type of engine, as is seen, the piston-rod was
attached to a cross-head working vertically, from which, at
each side, links, <i>B C</i>, connected with the &#8220;side-lever,&#8221;
<i>D E F</i>. The latter vibrated about a &#8220;main centre&#8221; at <i>E</i>,
like the overhead beam of the more common form of engine;
from its other end, a &#8220;connecting-rod,&#8221; <i>H</i>, led to the
&#8220;cross-tail,&#8221; <i>W</i>, which was, in turn, connected to the crank-pin,
<i>I</i>. The condenser, <i>M</i>, and air-pump, <i>Q</i>, were constructed
in the same manner as those of other engines, their
only peculiarities being such as were incident to their location
between the cylinder, <i>A</i>, and the crank, <i>I J</i>. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
paddle-wheels were of the common &#8220;radial&#8221; form, covered
in by paddle-boxes so strongly built that they were rarely
injured by the heaviest seas.</p>

<p>These vessels surpassed, for a time, all other sea-going
steamers in speed and comfort, and made their passages
with great regularity. The minimum length of voyage
of the Baltic and Pacific, of this line, was 9 days 19
hours.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the period the history of which
has been here given, the marine steam-engine became subject
to very marked changes in type and in details, and a
complete revolution was effected in the method of propulsion.
This change has finally resulted in the universal
adoption of a new propelling instrument, and in driving the
whole fleet of paddle-steamers from the ocean. The Great
Britain was a screw-steamer.</p>

<p>The screw-propeller, which, as has been stated, was
probably first proposed by Dr. Hooke in 1681, and by Dr.
Bernouilli, of Groningen, at about the middle of the eighteenth
century, and by Watt in 1784, was, at the end of the
century, tried experimentally in the United States by David
Bushnell, an ingenious American, who was then conducting
the experiments with torpedoes which were the cause of the
incident which originated that celebrated song by Francis
Hopkinson, the &#8220;Battle of the Kegs,&#8221; using the screw to
propel one of his submarine boats, and by John Fitch, and
by Dallery in France.</p>

<p>Joseph Bramah, of Great Britain, May 9, 1785, patented
a screw-propeller identical in general arrangement with
those used to-day. His sketch exhibits a screw, apparently
of very fair shape, carried on an horizontal shaft, which
passes out of the vessel through a stuffing-box, the screw
being wholly submerged. Bramah does not seem to have
put his plan in practice. It was patented again in England,
also, by Littleton in 1794, and by Shorter in 1800.</p>

<p>John Stevens, however, first gave the screw a practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
useful form, and used it successfully, in 1804 and 1805, on the
single and the twin screw boats which he built at that time.
This propelling instrument was also tried by Trevithick,
who planned a vessel to be propelled by a steam-engine
driving a screw, at about this time, and his scheme was laid
before the Navy Board in the year 1812. His plans included
an iron hull. Francis Pettit Smith tried the screw also in
the year 1808, and subsequently.</p>

<p>Joseph Ressel, a Bohemian, proposed to use a screw in
the propulsion of balloons, about 1812, and in the year
1826 proposed its use for marine propulsion. He is said to
have built a screw-boat in the year 1829, at Trieste, which
he named the Civetta. The little craft met with an accident
on the trial-trip, and nothing more was done.</p>

<p>The screw was finally brought into general use through
the exertions of John Ericsson, a skillful Swedish engineer,
who was residing in England in the year 1836, and of Mr.
F. P. Smith, an English farmer. Ericsson patented a peculiar
form of screw-propeller, and designed a steamer 40
feet in length, of 8 feet beam, and drawing 3 feet of water.
The screw was double, two shafts being placed the one
within the other, revolving in opposite directions, and carrying
the one a right-hand and the other a left-hand
screw. These screws were 5<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> feet in diameter. On her
trial-trip this little steamer attained a speed of 10 miles an
hour. Its power as a &#8220;tug&#8221; was found to be very satisfactory;
it towed a schooner of 140 tons burden at the rate of
7 miles, and the large American packet-ship Toronto was
towed on the Thames at a speed of 5 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Ericsson endeavored to interest the British Admiralty
in his improvements, and succeeded only so far as to induce
the Lords of the Admiralty to make an excursion with him
on the river. No interest was awakened in the new system,
and nothing was done by the naval authorities. A note to
the inventor from Captain Beaufort&mdash;one of the party&mdash;was
received shortly afterward, in which it was stated that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
excursionists had not found the performance of the little
vessel to equal their hopes and expectations. All the interests
of the then existing engine-building establishments
were opposed to the innovation, and the proverbial conservatism
of naval men and naval administrations aided in
procuring the rejection of Ericsson&#8217;s plans.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the United States, it happened, at that
time, that we had in Great Britain both civil and naval representatives
of greater intelligence, or of greater boldness
and enterprise. The consul at Liverpool was Mr. Francis
B. Ogden, of New Jersey, a gentleman who was somewhat
familiar with the steam-engine and with steam-navigation.
He had seen Ericsson&#8217;s plans at an earlier period, and had
at once seen their probable value. He was sufficiently confident
of success to place capital at the disposal of the inventor.
The little screw-boat just described was built with
funds of which he furnished a part, and was named, in his
honor, the Francis B. Ogden.</p>

<p>Captain Robert F. Stockton, an officer of the United
States Navy, and also a resident of New Jersey, was in
London at the time, and made an excursion with Ericsson
on the Ogden. He was also at once convinced of the value
of the new method of application of steam-power to ship-propulsion,
and gave the engineer an order to build two
iron screw-steamboats for use in the United States. Ericsson
was induced, by Messrs. Ogden and Stockton, to take up
his residence in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a
href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The Stockton was sent
over to the United States in April, 1839, under sail, and
was sold to the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal Company. Her
name was changed, and, as the New Jersey, she remained
in service many years.</p>

<p>The success of the boat built by Ericsson was so evident
that, although the naval authorities remained inactive,
a private company was formed, in 1839, to work the patents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of F. P. Smith, and this &#8220;Ship-Propeller Company&#8221; built
an experimental craft called the Archimedes, and its trial-trip
was made October 14th of the same year. The speed
attained was 9.64 miles an hour. The result was in every
respect satisfactory, and the vessel, subsequently, made
many voyages from port to port, and finally circumnavigated
the island of Great Britain. The proprietors of
the ship were not pecuniarily successful in their venture,
however, and the sale of the vessel left the company a
heavy loser. The Archimedes was 125 feet long, of 21 feet
10 inches beam, and 10 feet draught, registering 232 tons.
The engines were rated at 80 horse-power. Smith&#8217;s earlier
experiments (1837) were made with a little craft of 6 tons
burden, driven by an engine having a steam-cylinder 6
inches in diameter and 15 inches stroke of piston. The
funds needed were furnished by a London banker&mdash;Mr.
Wright.</p>

<p>Bennett Woodcroft had also used the screw experimentally
as early as 1832, on the Irwell, near Manchester, England,
in a boat of 55 tons burden. Twin-screws were used,
right and left handed respectively; they were each two feet
in diameter, and were given an expanding pitch. The boat
attained a speed of four miles an hour.</p>

<p>Experiments made subsequently (1843) with this form of
screw, and in competition with the &#8220;true&#8221; screw of Smith,
brought out very distinctly the superiority of the former,
and gave some knowledge of the proper proportions for
maximum efficiency. In later examples of the Woodcroft
screw, the blades were made detachable and adjustable&mdash;a
plan which is still a usual one, and which has proved to be,
in some respects, very convenient.</p>

<p>When Ericsson reached the United States, he was almost
immediately given an opportunity to build the Princeton&mdash;a
large screw-steamer&mdash;and at about the same time the
English and French Governments also had screw-steamers
built from his plans, or from those of his agent in England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Count de Rosen. In these latter ships&mdash;the Amphion
and the Pomona&mdash;the first horizontal direct-acting engines
ever built were used, and they were fitted with double-acting
air-pumps, having canvas valves and other novel
features. The great advantages exhibited by these vessels
over the paddle-steamers of the time did for screw-propulsion
what Stephenson&#8217;s locomotive&mdash;the Rocket&mdash;did for
railroad locomotion ten years earlier.</p>

<p>Congress, in 1839, had authorized the construction of
three war-vessels, and the Secretary of the Navy ordered
that two be at once built in the succeeding year. Of these,
one was the Princeton, the screw-steamer of which the machinery
was designed by Ericsson. The length of this vessel
was 164 feet, beam 30<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
feet, and depth 21<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet. The
ship drew from 16<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> to 18 feet of water, displacing at those
draughts 950 and 1,050 tons. The hull had a broad, flat
floor, with sharp entrance and fine run, and the lines were
considered at that time remarkably fine.</p>

<p>The screw was of gun-bronze, six-bladed, and was 14
feet in diameter and of 35 feet pitch; i. e., were there no
slip, the screw working as if in a solid nut, the ship would
have been driven forward 35 feet at each revolution.</p>

<p>The engines were two in number, and very peculiar in
form; the cylinder was, in fact, a <i>semi</i>-cylinder, and the
place of the piston-rod, as usually built, was taken by a vibrating
shaft, or &#8220;rock-shaft,&#8221; which carried a piston of
rectangular form, and which vibrated like a door on its
hinges as the steam was alternately let into and exhausted
from each side of it. The great rock-shaft carried, at the
outer end, an arm from which a connecting-rod led to the
crank, thus forming a &#8220;direct-acting engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The draught in the boilers was urged by blowers.
Ericsson had adopted this method of securing an artificial
draught ten years before, in one of his earlier vessels, the
Corsair. The Princeton carried a XII-inch wrought-iron
gun. This gun exploded after a few trials, with terribly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
disastrous results, causing the death of several distinguished
men, including members of the President&#8217;s cabinet.</p>

<p>The Princeton proved very successful as a screw-steamer,
attaining a speed of 13 knots, and was then considered
very remarkably fast. Captain Stockton, who commanded
the vessel, was most enthusiastic in praise of her.</p>

<p>Immediately there began a revolution in both civil and
naval ship-building, which progressed with great rapidity.
The Princeton was the first of the screw-propelled navy
which has now entirely displaced the older type of steam-vessel.
The introduction of the screw now took place with
great rapidity. Six steamers were fitted with Ericsson&#8217;s
screw in 1841, 9 in 1842, and nearly 30 in the year 1843.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, France, Germany, and other European
countries, the revolution was also finally effected, and was
equally complete. Nearly all sea-going vessels built toward
the close of the period here considered were screw-steamers,
fitted with direct-acting, quick-working engines. It was,
however, many years before the experience of engineers in
the designing and in the construction and management of
this new machinery enabled them to properly proportion it
for the various kinds of service to which they were called
upon to adapt it. Among other modifications of earlier practice
introduced by Ericsson was the surface-condenser with
a circulating pump driven by a small independent engine.</p>

<p>The screw was found to possess many advantages over
the paddle-wheel as an instrument for ship-propulsion.
The cost of machinery was greatly reduced by its use; the
expense of maintenance in working order was, however,
somewhat increased. The latter disadvantage was, nevertheless,
much more than compensated by an immense increase
in the economy of ship-propulsion, which marked
the substitution of the new instrument and its impelling
machinery.</p>

<p>When a ship is propelled by paddles, the motion of the
vessel creates, in consequence of the friction of the fluid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
against the sides and bottom, a current of water which
flows in the direction in which the ship is moving, and
forms a current following the ship for a time, and finally
losing all motion by contact with the surrounding mass of
water. All the power expended in the production of this
great stream is, in the case of the paddle-steamer, entirely
lost. In screw-steamers, however, the propelling instrument
works in this following current, and the tendency of
its action is to bring the agitated fluid to rest, taking up
and thus restoring, usefully, a large part of that energy
which would otherwise have been lost. The screw is also
completely covered by the water, and acts with comparative
efficiency in consequence of its submersion. The rotation
of the screw is comparatively rapid and smooth, also,
and this permits the use of small, light, fast-running engines.
The latter condition leads to economy of weight
and space, and consequently saves not only the cost of
transportation of the excess of weight of the larger kind of
engine, but, leaving so much more room for paying cargo,
the gain is found to be a double one. Still further, the
quick-running engine is, other things being equal, the most
economical of steam; and thus some expense is saved not
only in the purchase of fuel, but in its transportation, and
some still additional gain is derived from the increased
amount of paying cargo which the vessel is thus enabled to
carry. The change here described was thus found to be
productive of enormous direct gain. Indirectly, also, some
advantage was derived from the greater convenience of a
deck clear from machinery and the great paddle-shaft, in
the better storage of the lading, the greater facility with
which the masts and sails could be fitted and used; and
directly, again, in clear sides unencumbered by great paddle-boxes
which impeded the vessel by catching both sea
and wind.</p>

<p>The screw was, for some years, generally regarded as
simply auxiliary in large vessels, assisting the sails. Ultimately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the screw became the essential feature, and vessels
were lightly sparred and were given smaller areas of sail,
the latter becoming the auxiliary power.</p>

<p>In November of the year 1843, the screw-steamer Midas,
Captain Poor, a small schooner-rigged craft, left New
York for China, on probably the first voyage of such length
ever undertaken by a steamer; and in the following January
the Edith, Captain Lewis, a bark-rigged screw-vessel,
sailed from the same port for India and China. The Massachusetts,
Captain Forbes, a screw-steamship of about 800
tons, sailed for Liverpool September 15, 1845, the first voyage
of an American transatlantic passenger-steamer since
the Savannah&#8217;s pioneer adventure a quarter of a century
before. Two years later, American enterprise had placed
both screw and paddle steamers on the rivers of China&mdash;principally
through the exertions of Captain R. B. Forbes&mdash;and
steam-navigation was fairly established throughout
the world.</p>

<p>On comparing the screw-steamer of the present time
with the best examples of steamers propelled by paddle-wheels,
the superiority of the former is so marked that it
may cause some surprise that the revolution just described
should have progressed no more rapidly. The reason of
this slow progress, however, was probably that the introduction
of the rapidly-revolving screw, in place of the slow-moving
paddle-wheel, necessitated a complete revolution in
the design of their steam-engines; and the unavoidable
change from the heavy, long-stroked, low-speed engines
previously in use, to the light engines, with small cylinders
and high piston-speed, called for by the new system of propulsion,
was one that necessarily occurred slowly, and was
accompanied by its share of those engineering blunders and
accidents that invariably take place during such periods of
transition. Engineers had first to learn to design such engines
as should be reliable under the then novel conditions
of screw-propulsion, and their experience could only be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
gained through the occurrence of many mishaps and costly
failures. The best proportions of engines and screws, for a
given ship, were determined only by long experience, although
great assistance was derived from the extensive series
of experiments made with the French steamer Pelican.
It also became necessary to train up a body of engine-drivers
who should be capable of managing these new engines; for
they required the exercise of a then unprecedented amount
of care and skill. Finally, with the accomplishment of
these two requisites to success must simultaneously occur
the enlightenment of the public, professional as well as
non-professional, in regard to their advantages. Thus it
happens that it is only after a considerable time that the
screw attained its proper place as an instrument of propulsion,
and finally drove the paddle-wheel quite out of use,
except in shoal water.</p>

<p>Now our large screw-steamers are of higher speed than
any paddle-steamers on the ocean, and develop their power
at far less cost. This increased economy is due not only to
the use of a more efficient propelling instrument, and to
changes already described, but also, in a great degree, to
the economy which has followed as a consequence of other
changes in the steam-engine driving it. The earliest days
of screw-propulsion witnessed the use of steam of from 5
to 15 pounds pressure, in a geared engine using jet-condensation,
and giving a horse-power at an expense of perhaps
7 to 10, or even more, pounds of coal per hour. A little
later came direct-acting engines with jet-condensation and
steam at 20 pounds pressure, costing about 5 or 6 pounds
per horse-power per hour. The steam-pressure rose a little
higher with the use of greater expansion, and the economy
of fuel was further improved. The introduction of the surface-condenser,
which began to be generally adopted some
ten years ago, brought down the cost of power to from 3
to 4 pounds in the better class of engines. At about the
same time, this change to surface-condensation helping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
greatly to overcome those troubles arising from boiler-incrustation
which had prevented the rise of steam-pressure
above about 25 pounds per square inch, and as, at the same
time, it was learned by engineers that the deposit of lime-scale
in the marine boiler was determined by temperature
rather than by the degree of concentration, and that all the
lime entering the boiler was deposited at the pressure just
mentioned, a sudden advance took place. Careful design,
good workmanship, and skillful management, made the surface-condenser
an efficient apparatus; and, the dangers of
incrustation being thus lessened, the movement toward
higher pressures recommenced, and progressed so rapidly
that now 75 pounds per square inch is very usual, and
more than 125 pounds has since been attained.</p>

<p>The close of this period was marked by the construction
of the most successful types of paddle-steamers, the
complete success of transoceanic steam-transportation, the
introduction of the screw-propeller and the peculiar engine
appropriate to it, and, finally, a general improvement, which
had finally become marked both in direction and in rapidity
of movement, leading toward the use of higher steam-pressure,
greater expansion, lighter and more rapidly-working
machinery, and decidedly better design and construction,
and the use of better material. The result of these
changes was seen in economy of first cost and maintenance,
and the ability to attain greater speed, and to assure greater
safety to passengers and less risk to cargo.</p>

<p>The introduction of the changes just noted finally led
to the last great change in the form of the marine steam-engine,
and a revolution was inaugurated, which, however,
only became complete in the succeeding period. The non-success
of Hornblower and of Wolff, and others who had
attempted to introduce the &#8220;compound&#8221; or double-cylinder
engine on land, had not convinced all engineers that it
might not yet be made a successful rival of the then standard
type; and the three or four steamers which were built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
for the Hudson River at the end of the first quarter of the
nineteenth century are said to have been very successful
vessels. Carrying 75 to 100 pounds of steam in their boilers,
the Swiftsure and her contemporaries were by that circumstance
well fitted to make that form of engine economically
a success. This form of engine was built occasionally
during the succeeding quarter of a century, but only became
a recognized standard type after the close of the epoch to
the history of which this chapter is devoted. That latest
and greatest advance in the direction of increased efficiency
in the marine steam-engine was, however, commenced very
soon after Watt&#8217;s death, and its completion was the work
of nearly a half-century.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Period of Refinement&mdash;1850 to Date.</span></h4>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>By the middle of the present century, as we have now
seen, the steam-engine had been applied, and successfully,
to every great purpose for which it was fitted. Its first
application was to the elevation of water; it next was applied
to the driving of mills and machinery; and it finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
became the great propelling power in transportation by
land and by sea.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the period to which we are now
come, these applications of steam-power had become familiar
both to the engineer and to the public. The forms of
engine adapted to each purpose had been determined, and
had become usually standard. Every type of the modern
steam-engine had assumed, more or less closely, the form
and proportions which are now familiar; and the most
intelligent designers and builders had been taught&mdash;by experience
rather than by theory, for the theory of the steam-engine
had then been but little investigated, and the principles
and laws of thermo-dynamics had not been traced in
their application to this engine&mdash;the principles of construction
essential to successful practice, and were gradually
learning the relative standing of the many forms of steam-engine,
from among which have been preserved a few specially
fitted for certain specific methods of utilization of
power.</p>

<p>During the years succeeding the date 1850, therefore,
the growth of the steam-engine had been, not a change of
standard type, or the addition of new parts, but a gradual
improvement in forms, proportions, and arrangements of
details; and this period has been marked by the dying out
of the forms of engine least fitted to succeed in competition
with others, and the retention of the latter has been an example
of &#8220;the survival of the fittest.&#8221; This has therefore
been a Period of Refinement.</p>

<p>During this period invention has been confined to details;
it has produced new forms of parts, new arrangements
of details; it has devised an immense variety of
valves, valve-motions, regulating apparatus, and a still
greater variety of steam-boilers and of attachments, essential
and non-essential, to both engines and boilers. The
great majority of these peculiar devices have been of no
value, and very many of the best of them have been found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to have about equal value. All the well-known and successful
forms of engine, when equally well designed and constructed
and equally well managed, are of very nearly equal
efficiency; all of the best-known types of steam-boiler,
where given equal proportions of grate to heating-surface
and equally well designed, with a view to securing a good
draught and a good circulation of water, have been found
to give very nearly equally good results; and it has become
evident that a good knowledge of principles and of
practice, on the part of the designer, the constructor, and
the manager of the boiler, is essential in the endeavor to
achieve economical success; that good engineering is demanded,
rather than great ingenuity. The inventor has
been superseded here by the engineer.</p>

<p>The knowledge acquired in the time of Watt, of the
essential principles of steam-engine construction, has since
become generally familiar to the better class of engineers.
It has led to the selection of simple, strong, and durable
forms of engine and boiler, to the introduction of various
kinds of valves and of valve-gearing, capable of adjustment
to any desired range of expansive working, and to the attachment
of efficient forms of governor to regulate the speed of
the engine, by determining automatically the point of cut-off
which will, at any instant, best adjust the energy exerted
by the expanding steam to the demand made by the work
to be done.</p>

<p>The value of high pressures and considerable expansion
was recognized as long ago as in the early part of the present
century, and Watt, by combining skillfully the several
principal parts of the steam-engine, gave it very nearly
the shape which it has to-day. The compound engine,
even, as has been seen, was invented by contemporaries of
Watt, and the only important modifications since his time
have occurred in details. The introduction of the &#8220;drop
cut-off,&#8221; the attachment of the governor to the expansion-apparatus
in such a manner as to determine the degree of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
expansion, the improvement of proportions, the introduction
of higher steam and greater expansion, the improvement of
the marine engine by the adoption of surface-condensation,
in addition to these other changes, and the introduction of
the double-cylinder engine, after the elevation of steam-pressure
and increase of expansion had gone so far as to
justify its use, are the changes, therefore, which have taken
place during this last quarter-century. It began then to be
generally understood that expansion of steam produced
economy, and mechanics and inventors vied with each other
in the effort to obtain a form of valve-gear which should
secure the immense saving which an abstract consideration
of the expansion of gases according to Marriotte&#8217;s law
would seem to promise. The counteracting phenomena of
internal condensation and re&euml;vaporation, of the losses of
heat externally and internally, and of the effect of defective
vacuum, defective distribution of steam, and of back-pressure,
were either unobserved or were entirely overlooked.</p>

<p>It was many years, therefore, before engine-builders became
convinced that no improvement upon existing forms
of expansion-gear could secure even an approximation to
theoretical efficiency.</p>

<p>The fact thus learned, that the benefit of expansive
working has a limit which is very soon reached in ordinary
practice, was not then, and has only recently become, generally
known among our steam-engine builders, and for
several years, during the period upon which we now enter,
there continued the keenest competition between makers of
rival forms of expansion-gear, and inventors were continually
endeavoring to produce something which should far
excel any previously-existing device.</p>

<p>In Europe, as in the United States, efforts to &#8220;improve&#8221;
standard designs have usually resulted in injuring their
efficiency, and in simply adding to the first cost and running
expense of the engines, without securing a marked
increase in economy in the consumption of steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Stationary Engines</span>&#8221; had been applied to the operation
of mill-machinery, as has been seen, by Watt and by
Murdoch, his assistant and pupil; and Watt&#8217;s competitors,
in Great Britain and abroad, had made considerable progress
before the death of the great engineer, in its adaptation to
its work. In the United States, Oliver Evans had introduced
the non-condensing high-pressure stationary engine,
which was the progenitor of the standard engine of that type
which is now used far more generally than any other form.
These engines were at first rude in design, badly proportioned,
rough and inaccurate as to workmanship, and uneconomical
in their consumption of fuel. Gradually, however,
when made by reputable builders, they assumed neat and
strong shapes, good proportions, and were well made and
of excellent materials, doing their work with comparatively
little waste of heat or of fuel.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig93" id="Fig93"></a>
<img src="images/illo335.png" alt="Vertical Stationary Engine" width="263" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;Vertical Stationary Steam-Engine.</p></div>

<p>One of the neatest and best modern designs of stationary
engine for small powers is seen in <a href="#Fig93">Fig. 93</a>, which represents
a &#8220;vertical direct-acting engine,&#8221; with base-plate&mdash;a
form which is a favorite with many engineers.</p>

<p>The engine shown in the engraving consists of two principal
parts, the cylinder and the frame, which is a tapering
column having openings in the sides, to allow free access
to all the working parts within. The slides and pillow-blocks
are cast with the column, so that they cannot become
loose or out of line; the rubbing surfaces are large
and easily lubricated. Owing to the vertical position, there
is no tendency to side wear of cylinder or piston. The
packing-rings are self-adjusting, and work free but tight.
The crank is counterbalanced; the crank-pin, cross-head pin,
piston-rod, valve-stem, etc., are made of steel; all the bearing
surfaces are made extra large, and are accurately fitted;
and the best quality of Babbitt-metal only used for the
journal-bearings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>The smaller sizes of these engines, from 2 to 10 horse-power,
have both pillow-blocks cast in the frame, giving a
bearing each side of the double cranks. They are built by
some constructors in quantities, and parts duplicated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
special machinery (as in fire-arms and sewing-machines),
which secures great accuracy and uniformity of workmanship,
and allows of any part being quickly and cheaply
replaced, when worn or broken by accident. The next figure
is a vertical section through the same engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig94" id="Fig94"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;Vertical Stationary Steam-Engine. Section.</p></div>

<p>Engines fitted with the ordinary rigid bearings require
to be erected on a firm foundation, and to be kept in perfect
line. If, by the settling of the foundation, or from any
other cause, they get out of line, heating, cutting, and
thumping result. To obviate this, modern engines are often
fitted with self-adjusting bearings throughout; this gives
the engine great flexibility and freedom from friction. The
accompanying cuts show clearly how this is accomplished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
The pillow-block has a spherical shell turned and fitted into
the spherically-bored pillow-block, thus allowing a slight
angular motion in any direction. The connecting-rod is
forged in a single piece, without straps, gibs, or key, and is
mortised through at each end for the reception of the brass
boxes, which are curved on their backs, and fit the cheek-pieces,
between which they can turn to adjust themselves
to the pins, in the plane of the axis of the rod. The adjustment
for wear is made by wedge-blocks and set screws,
as shown, and they are so constructed that the parts cannot
get loose and cause a break-down. The cross-head has
adjustable gibs on each side, turned to fit the slides, which
are cast solidly in the frame, and bored out exactly in the
line with the cylinder. This permits it freely to turn on its
axis, and, in connection with the adjustable boxes in the
connecting-rod, allows a perfect self-adjustment to the line of
the crank-pin. The out-board bearing may be moved an inch
or more out of position in any direction, without detriment to
the running of the engine, all bearings accommodating themselves
perfectly to whatever position the shaft may assume.</p>

<p>The ports and valve-passages are proportioned as in
locomotive practice. The valve-seat is adapted to the ordinary
plain slide or D-valve, should it be preferred, but the
balanced piston slide-valve works with equal ease whether
the steam-pressure is 10 or 100 pounds, and at the same time
gives double steam and exhaust openings, which greatly facilitates
the entrance of the steam to, and its escape from, the
cylinder, thus securing a nearer approach to boiler-pressure
and a less back-pressure, saving the power required to work
an ordinary valve, and reducing the wear of valve-gear.</p>

<p>This is a type of engine frequently seen in the United
States, but more rarely in Europe. It is an excellent form
of engine. The vertical direct-acting engine is sometimes,
though rarely, built of very considerable size, and these
large engines are more frequently seen in rolling-mills than
elsewhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Where much power is required, the stationary engine is
usually an horizontal direct-acting engine, having a more
or less effective cut-off valve-gear, according to the size of
engine and the cost of fuel. A good example of the simpler
form of this kind of engine is the small horizontal
slide-valve engine, with independent cut-off valve riding on
the back of the main valve&mdash;a combination generally known
among engineers as the Meyer system of valve-gear. This
form of steam-engine is a very effective machine, and does
excellent work when properly proportioned to yield the required
amount of power. It is well adapted to an expansion
of from four to five times. Its disadvantages are the
difficulty which it presents in the attachment of the regulator,
to determine the point of cut-off by the heavy work
which it throws upon the governor when attached, and the
rather inflexible character of the device as an expansive
valve-gear. The best examples of this class of engine have
neat heavy bed-plates, well-designed cylinders and details,
smooth-working valve-gear, the expansion-valve adjusted
by a right and left hand screw, and regulation secured by
the attachment of the governor to the throttle-valve.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig95" id="Fig95"></a>
<img src="images/illo339.png" alt="Horizontal Stationary Steam-Engine" width="484" height="300" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span>&mdash;Horizontal Stationary Steam-Engine.</p></div>

<p>The engine shown in the accompanying illustration
(<a href="#Fig95">Fig. 95</a>) is an example of an excellent British stationary
steam-engine. It is simple, strong, and efficient. The
frame, front cylinder-head, cross-head guides, and crank-shaft
&#8220;plumber-block,&#8221; are cast in one piece, as has so
generally been done in the United States for a long time
by some of our manufacturers. The cylinder is secured
against the end of the bed-plate, as was first done by Corliss.
The crank-pin is set in a counterbalanced disk. The
valve-gear is simple, and the governor effective, and provided
with a safety-device to prevent injury by the breaking
of the governor-belt. An engine of this kind of 10
inches diameter of cylinder, 20 inches stroke of piston, is
rated by the builders at about 25 horse-power; a similar
engine 30 inches in diameter of cylinder would yield from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312-313]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a></span>225 to 250 horse-power. In this example, all parts are made
to exact size by gauges standardized to Whitworth&#8217;s sizes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig96" id="Fig96"></a>
<img src="images/illo340.png" alt="Horizontal Stationary Steam-Engine" width="550" height="300" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span>&mdash;Horizontal Stationary Steam-Engine.</p></div>

<p>In American engines (as is seen in <a href="#Fig96">Fig. 96</a>), usually, two
supports are placed&mdash;the one under the latter bearing, and
the other under the cylinder&mdash;to take the weight of the engine;
and through them it is secured to the foundation.
As in the vertical engine already described, a valve is
sometimes used, consisting of two pistons connected by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
rod, and worked by an ordinary eccentric. By a simple
arrangement these pistons have always the same pressure inside
as out, which prevents any leakage or blowing through;
and they are said always to work equally as well and free
from friction under 150 pounds pressure as under 10 pounds
per square inch, and to require no adjustment. It is more
usual, however, to adopt the three-ported valve used on
locomotives, with (frequently) a cut-off valve on the back
of this main valve, which cut-off valve is adjusted either
by hand or by the governor.</p>

<p>Engines of the class just described are especially well
fitted, by their simplicity, compactness, and solidity, to
work at the high piston-speeds which are gradually becoming
generally adopted in the effort to attain increased
economy of fuel by the reduction of the immense losses of
heat which occur in the expansion of steam in the metallic
cylinders through which we are now compelled to work it.</p>

<p>One of the best known of recent engines is the Allen
engine, a steam-engine having the same general arrangement
of parts seen in the above illustration, but fitted with
a peculiar valve-gear, and having proportions of parts which
are especially calculated to secure smoothness of motion
and uniformity of pressure on crank-pin and journals, at
speeds so high that the inertia of the reciprocating parts
becomes a seriously-important element in the calculation of
the distribution of stresses and their effect on the dynamics
of the machine.</p>

<p>In the Allen engine,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the cylinder and frame are connected
as in the engine seen above, and the crank-disk,
shaft-bearings, and other principal details, are not essentially
different. The valve-gear<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> differs in having four valves,
one at each end on the steam as well as on the exhaust side,
all of which are balanced and work with very little resistance.
These valves are not detachable, but are driven by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a link attached to and moved by an eccentric on the main
shaft, the position of the valve-rod attachment to which
link is determined by the governor, and the degree of expansion
is thus adjusted to the work of the engine. The
engine has usually a short stroke, not exceeding twice the
diameter of cylinder, and is driven at very high speed, generally
averaging from 600 to 800 feet per minute.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> This
high piston-speed and short stroke give very great velocity
of rotation. The effect is, therefore, to produce an exceptional
smoothness of motion, while permitting the use of
small fly-wheels. Its short stroke enables entire solidity to
be attained in a bed of rigid form, making it a very completely
self-contained engine, adapted to the heaviest work,
and requiring only a small foundation.</p>

<p>The journals of the shaft, and all cylindrical wearing
surfaces, are finished by grinding in a manner that leaves
them perfectly round. The crank-pin and cross-head pin
are hardened before being ground. The joints of the valve-gear
consist of pins turning in solid ferrules in the rod-ends,
both hardened and ground. After years of constant use
thus, no wear occasioning lost time in the valve-movements
has been detected.</p>

<p>High speed and short strokes are essential elements of
economy. It is now well understood that all the surfaces
with which the steam comes in contact condense it.</p>

<p>Obviously, one way to diminish this loss is to reduce the
extent of surface to which the steam is exposed. In engines
of high speed and short stroke, the surfaces with which the
steam comes in contact, while doing a given amount of
work, present less area than in ordinary engines running at
low speed. Where great steadiness of motion is desired,
the expense of coupled engines is often incurred. Quick-running
engines do not require to be coupled; a single
engine may give greater uniformity of motion than is usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
obtained with coupled engines at ordinary speeds. The
ports and valve-movements, the weight of the reciprocating
parts, and the size and weight of the fly-wheels, should be
calculated expressly for the speeds chosen.</p>

<p>The economy of the engine here described is unexcelled
by the best of the more familiar &#8220;drop cut-off&#8221; engines.</p>

<p>An engine reported upon by a committee of the American
Institute, of which Dr. Barnard was chairman, was
non-condensing, 16 inches in diameter of cylinder, 30 inches
stroke, making 125 revolutions per minute, and developed
over 125 horse-power with 75 pounds of steam in the boiler,
using 25<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pounds of steam per indicated horse-power, and
2.87 pounds of coal&mdash;an extraordinarily good performance
for an engine of such small power.</p>

<p>The governor used on this engine is known as the Porter
governor. It is given great power and delicacy by
weighting it down, and thus obtaining a high velocity of
rotation, and by suspending the balls from forked arms,
which are given each two bearing-pins separated laterally
so far as to permit considerable force to be exerted in
changing speeds without cramping those bearings sufficiently
to seriously impair the sensitiveness of the governor.
This engine as a whole may be regarded as a good representative
of the high-speed engine of to-day.</p>

<p>Since this change in the direction of high speeds has
already gone so far that the &#8220;drop cut-off&#8221; is sometimes
inapplicable, in consequence of the fact that the piston
would, were such a valve-gear adopted, reach the end of
its stroke before the detached valve could reach its seat;
and since this progress is only limited by our attainments
in mechanical skill and accuracy, it seems probable that
the &#8220;positive-motion expansion-gear&#8221; type of engine will
ultimately supersede the now standard &#8220;drop cut-off engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The best known and most generally used class of stationary
engines at the present time is, however, that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
has the so-called &#8220;drop cut-off,&#8221; or &#8220;detachable valve-gear.&#8221;
The oldest well-known form of valve-motion of this description
now in use is that known as the Sickels cut-off,
patented by Frederick E. Sickels, an American mechanic,
about the year 1841, and also built by Hogg, of New York,
who placed it upon the engine of the steamer South America.
The invention is claimed for both Hogg and Sickels.
It was introduced by the inventor in a form which especially
adapted it to use with the beam-engine used on the
Eastern waters of the United States, and was adapted to
stationary engines by Messrs. Thurston, Greene &amp; Co., of
Providence, R. I., who made use of it for some years before
any other form of &#8220;drop cut-off&#8221; came into general use.
The Sickels cut-off consisted of a set of steam-valves, usually
independent of the exhaust-valves, and each raised by
a catch, which could be thrown out, at the proper moment,
by a wedge with which it came in contact as it rose with
the opening valve. This wedge, or other equivalent device,
was so adjusted that the valve should be detached and fall to
its seat when the piston reached that point in its movement,
after taking steam, at which expansion was to commence.
From this point, no steam entering the cylinder, the piston
was impelled by the expanding vapor. The valve was usually
the double-poppet. Sickels subsequently invented what
was called the &#8220;beam-motion,&#8221; to detach the valve at any
point in the stroke. As at first arranged, the valve could
only be detached during the earlier half-stroke, since at
mid-stroke the direction of motion of the eccentric rod was
reversed and the valve began to descend. By introducing a
&#8220;wiper&#8221; having a motion transverse to that of the valve
and its catch, and by giving this wiper a motion coincident
with that of the piston by connecting it with the beam or
other part of the engine moving with the piston, he obtained
a kinematic combination which permitted the valve
to be detached at any point in the stroke, adding a very
simple contrivance which enabled the attendant to set the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
wiper so that it should strike the catch at any time during
the forward movement of the &#8220;beam-motion.&#8221;</p>

<p>On stationary engines, the point of cut-off was afterward
determined by the governor, which was made to operate
the detaching mechanism, the combination forming what
is sometimes called an &#8220;automatic&#8221; cut-off. The attachment
of the governor so as to determine the degree of expansion
had been proposed before Sickels&#8217;s time. One of
the earliest of these contrivances was that of Zachariah
Allen, in 1834, using a cut-off valve independent of the
steam-valve. The first to so attach the governor to a <i>drop
cut-off</i> valve-motion was George H. Corliss, who made it
a feature of the Corliss valve-gear in 1849. In the year
1855, N. T. Greene introduced a form of expansion-gear,
in which he combined the range of the Sickels beam-motion
device with the expansion-adjustment gained by the attachment
of the governor, and with the advantages of flat slide-valves
at all ports&mdash;both steam and exhaust.</p>

<p>Many other ingenious forms of expansion valve-gear
have been invented, and several have been introduced,
which, properly designed and proportioned to well-planned
engines, and with good construction and management,
should give economical results little if at all inferior to
those just named. Among the most ingenious of these
later devices is that of Babcock &amp; Wilcox, in which a very
small auxiliary steam-cylinder and piston is employed to
throw the cut-off valve over its port at the instant at which
the steam is to be cut off. A very beautiful form of isochronous
governor is used on this engine, to regulate the
speed of the engine by determining the point of cut-off.</p>

<p>In Wright&#8217;s engine, the expansion is adjusted by the
movement, by the regulator, of cams which operate the
steam-valves so that they shall hold the valve open a longer
or shorter time, as required.</p>

<p>Since compactness and lightness are not as essential as
in portable, locomotive, and marine engines, the parts are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
arranged, in stationary engines, with a view simply to securing
efficiency, and the design is determined by circumstances.
It was formerly usual to adopt the condensing
engine in mills, and wherever a stationary engine was required.
In Europe generally, and to some extent in the
United States, where a supply of condensing water is obtainable,
condensing engines and moderate steam-pressures
are still employed. But this type of engine is gradually
becoming superseded by the high-pressure condensing engine,
with considerable expansion, and with an expansion-gear
in which the point of cut-off is determined by the
governor.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98</span>&mdash;Corliss Engine Valve-Motion.</p></div>

<p>The best-known engine of this class is the Corliss engine,
which is very extensively used in the United States,
and which has been copied very generally by European
builders. <a href="#Fig97">Fig. 97</a> represents the Corliss engine. The
horizontal steam-cylinder is bolted firmly to the end of the
frame, which is so formed as to transmit the strain to the
main journal with the greatest directness. The frame carries
the guides for the cross-head, which are both in the
same vertical plane. The valves are four in number, a
steam and an exhaust valve being placed at each end of the
steam-cylinder. Short steam-passages are thus secured, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
this diminution of clearance is a source of some economy.
Both sets of valves are driven by an eccentric operating a
disk or wrist-plate, <i>E</i> (<a href="#Fig98">Fig. 98</a>), which vibrates on a pin projecting
from the cylinder. Short links reaching from this
wrist-plate to the several valves, <i>D D</i>, <i>F F</i>, move them with
a peculiarly varying motion, opening and closing them rapidly,
and moving them quite slowly when the port is either
nearly open or almost closed. This effect is ingeniously
secured by so placing the pins on the wrist-plate that their
line of motion becomes nearly transverse to the direction of
the valve-links when the limit of movement is approached.
The links connecting the wrist-plate with the arms moving
the steam-valves have catches at their extremities, which
are disengaged by coming in contact, as the arm swings
around with the valve-stem, with a cam adjusted by the
governor. This adjustment permits the steam to follow the
piston farther when the engine is caused to &#8220;slow down,&#8221;
and thus tends to restore the proper speed. It disengages
the steam-valve earlier, and expands the steam to a greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
extent, when the engine begins to run above the proper
speed. When the catch is thrown out, the valve is closed
by a weight or a strong spring. To prevent jar when the
motion of the valve is checked, a &#8220;dash-pot&#8221; is used, invented
originally by F. E. Sickels. This is a vessel having
a nicely-fitted piston, which is received by a &#8220;cushion&#8221; of
water or air when the piston suddenly enters the cylinder
at the end of the valve-movement. In the original water
dash-pot of Sickels, the cylinder is vertical, and the plunger
or piston descends upon a small body of water confined in
the base of the dash-pot. Corliss&#8217;s air dash-pot is now often
set horizontally.</p>

<img src="images/illo348.png" alt="Greene Engine" width="350" height="460" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>&mdash;Greene Engine.</p></div>

<p>In the Greene steam-engine (<a href="#Fig99">Fig. 99</a>), the valves
are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
four in number, as in the Corliss. The cut-off gear consists
of a bar, <i>A</i>, moved by the steam-eccentric in a direction
parallel with the centre-line of the cylinder and nearly coincident
as to time with the piston. On this bar are tappets,
<i>C C</i>, supported by springs and adjustable in height by
the governor, <i>G</i>. These tappets engage the arms <i>B B</i>, on
the ends of rock-shafts, <i>E E</i>, which move the steam-valves
and remain in contact with them a longer or shorter time,
and holding the valve open during a greater or less part of
the piston-stroke, as the governor permits the tappets to
rise with diminishing engine-speed, or forces them down as
speed increases. The exhaust-valves are moved by an independent
eccentric rod, which is itself moved by an eccentric
set, as is usual with the Corliss and with other engines
generally, at right angles with the crank. This engine, in
consequence of the independence of the steam-eccentric,
and of the contemporary movement of steam valve-motion
and steam-piston, is capable of cutting off at any point
from beginning to nearly the end of the stroke. The usual
arrangement, by which steam and exhaust valves are moved
by the same eccentric, only permits expansion with the
range from the beginning to half-stroke. In the Corliss
engine the latter construction is retained, with the object,
in part, of securing a means of closing the valve by a &#8220;positive
motion,&#8221; should, by any accident, the closing not be
effected by the weight or spring usually relied upon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>The steam-valve of the Greene engine, as designed by
the author, is seen in <a href="#Fig100">Fig. 100</a>, where the valve, <i>G H</i>, covering
the port, <i>D</i>, in the steam-cylinder, <i>A B</i>, is moved by
the rod, <i>J J</i>, connected to the rock-shaft, <i>M</i>, by the arm,
<i>L K</i>. The line, <i>K I</i>, should, when carried out, intersect
the valve-face at its middle point, under <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the American stationary engine,
therefore, are high steam-pressure without condensation, an
expansion valve-gear with drop cut-off adjustable by the
governor, high piston-speed, and lightness combined with
strength of construction. The pressure most commonly
adopted in the boilers which furnish steam to this type of
engine is from 75 to 80 pounds per square inch; but a
pressure of 100 pounds is not infrequently carried, and the
latter pressure may be regarded as a &#8220;mean maximum,&#8221;
corresponding to a pressure of 60 pounds at about the
commencement of the period here considered&mdash;1850.</p>

<p>Very much greater pressures have, however, been adopted
by some makers, and immensely &#8220;higher steam&#8221; has
been experimented with by several engineers. As early as
1823, Jacob Perkins<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a
href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> commenced experimenting with steam
of very great tension. As has already been stated, the usual
pressure at the time of Watt was but a few pounds&mdash;5 or
7&mdash;in excess of that of the atmosphere. Evans, Trevithick,
and Stevens, had previously worked steam at pressures of
from 50 to 75 pounds per square inch, and pressures on the
Western rivers and elsewhere in the United States had already
been raised to 100 or 150 pounds, and explosions were
becoming alarmingly frequent.</p>

<p>Perkins&#8217;s experimental apparatus consisted of a copper
boiler, of a capacity of about one cubic foot, having sides
3 inches in thickness. It was closed at the bottom and
top, and had five small pipes leading from the upper head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
This was placed in a furnace kept at a high temperature by
a forced combustion. Safety-valves loaded respectively to
425 and 550 pounds per square inch were placed on each of
two of the steam-pipes.</p>

<p>Perkins used the steam generated under these great
pressures in a little engine having a piston 2 inches in diameter
and a stroke of 1 foot. It was rated at 10 horse-power.<a name="FNanchor_89_89"
id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1827, Perkins had attained working pressures,
in a single-acting, single-cylinder engine, of upward
of 800 pounds per square inch. At pressures exceeding 200
pounds, he had much trouble in securing effective lubrication,
as all oils charred and decomposed at the high temperatures
then unavoidably encountered, and he finally succeeded
in evading this seemingly insurmountable obstacle
by using for rubbing parts a peculiar alloy which required
no lubrication, and which became so beautifully polished,
after some wear, that the friction was less than where lubricants
were used. At these high pressures Perkins seems
to have met with no other serious difficulty. He condensed
the exhaust-steam and returned it to the boiler, but did not
attempt to create a vacuum in his condenser, and therefore
needed no air-pump. Steam was cut off at one-eighth
stroke.</p>

<p>In the same year, Perkins made a compound engine on
the Woolf plan, and adopted a pressure of 1,400 pounds, expanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
eight times. In still another engine, intended for a
steam-vessel, Perkins adopted, or proposed to adopt, 2,000
pounds pressure, cutting off the admission at one-sixteenth,
in single-acting engines of 6 inches diameter of cylinder
and 20 inches stroke of piston. The steam did not retain
boiler-pressure at the cylinder, and this engine was only
rated at 30 horse-power.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Stuart follows a description of Perkins&#8217;s work in the
improvement of the steam-engine and the introduction of
steam-artillery by the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220; ... No other mechanic of the day has done more
to illustrate an obscure branch of philosophy by a series of
difficult, dangerous, and expensive experiments; no one&#8217;s
labors have been more deserving of cheering encouragement,
and no one has received less. Even in their present
state, his experiments are opening new fields for philosophical
research, and his mechanism bids fair to introduce a
new style into the proportions, construction, and form, of
steam-machinery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perkins&#8217;s experience was no exception to the general
rule, which denies to nearly all inventors a fair return for
the benefits which they confer upon mankind.</p>

<p>Another engineer, a few years later, was also successful
in controlling and working steam under much higher pressures
than are even now in use. This was Dr. Ernst Alban,
a distinguished German engine-builder, of Plau, Mecklenburg,
and an admirer of Oliver Evans, in whose path he, a
generation later, advanced far beyond that great pioneer.
Writing in 1843, he describes a system of engine and boiler
construction, with which he used steam under pressures
about equal to those experimentally worked by Jacob Perkins,
Evans&#8217;s American successor. Alban&#8217;s treatise was
translated and printed in Great Britain,<a name="FNanchor_91_91"
id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> four years later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>Alban, on one occasion, used steam of 1,000 pounds
pressure. His boilers were similar in general form to the
boiler patented by Stevens in 1805, but the tubes were horizontal
instead of vertical. He evaporated from 8 to 10
pounds of water into steam of 600 to 800 pounds pressure
with each pound of coal. He states that the difficulty met
by Perkins&mdash;the decomposition of lubricants in the steam-cylinder&mdash;did
not present itself in his experiments, even
when working steam at a pressure of 600 pounds on the
square inch, and he found that less lubrication was needed
at such high pressures than in ordinary practice. Alban
expanded his steam about as much as Evans, in his usual
practice, carrying a pressure of 150 pounds, and cutting off
at one-third; he adopted greatly increased piston-speed, attaining
300 feet per minute, at a time when common practice
had only reached 200 feet. He usually built an oscillating
engine, and rarely attached a condenser. The valve was the
locomotive-slide.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a
href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The stroke was made short to secure
strength, compactness, cheapness, and high speed of rotation;
but Alban does not seem to have understood the
principles controlling the form and proportions of the expansive
engine, or the necessity of adopting considerable
expansion in order to secure economy in working steam of
great tension, and therefore was, apparently, not aware of
the advantages of a long stroke in reducing losses by &#8220;dead-space,&#8221;
in reducing risk of annoyance by hot journals, or in
enabling high piston-speeds to be adopted. He seems
never to have attained a sufficiently high speed of piston to
become aware that the oscillating cylinder cannot be used
at speeds perfectly practicable with the fixed cylinder.</p>

<p>Alban states that one of his smallest engines, having a
cylinder 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches in diameter and 1 foot stroke of piston,
with a piston-speed of but 140 to 160 feet per minute, developed
4 horse-power, with a consumption of 5.3 pounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of coal per hour. This is a good result for so small an
amount of work, and for an engine working at so low a
speed of piston. An engine of 30 horse-power, also working
very slowly, required but 4.1 pounds of coal per hour
per horse-power.</p>

<p>The work of Perkins and of Alban, like that of their
predecessors, Evans, Stevens, and Trevithick, was, however,
the work of engineers who were far ahead of their time.
The general practice, up to the time which marked the
beginning of the modern &#8220;period of refinement,&#8221; had been
but gradually approximating that just described. Higher
pressures were slowly approached; higher piston-speeds
came slowly into use; greater expansion was gradually
adopted; the causes of losses of heat were finally discovered,
and steam-jacketing and external non-conducting coverings
were more and more generally applied as builders
became more familiar with their work. The &#8220;compound
engine&#8221; was now and then adopted; and each experiment,
made with higher steam and greater expansion, was more
nearly successful than the last.</p>

<p>Finally, all these methods of securing economy became
recognized, and the reasons for their adoption became
known. It then remained, as the final step in this progression,
to combine all these requisites of economical working
in a double-cylinder engine, steam-jacketed, well protected
by non-conducting coverings, working steam of high pressure,
and with considerable expansion at high piston-speed.
This is now done by the best builders.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of this type of engine is that
constructed by the sons of Jacob Perkins, who continued
the work of their father after his death. Their engines are
single-acting, and the small or high-pressure cylinder is
placed on the top of the larger or low-pressure cylinder.
The valves are worked by rotating stems, and the loss of
heat and burning of packing incident to the use of the common
method are thus avoided. The stuffing-boxes are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
placed at the end of long sleeves, closely surrounding the
vertical valve-stems also, and the water of condensation
which collects in these sleeves is an additional and thorough
protection against excessively high temperature at the packing.
The piston-rings are made of the alloy which has been
found to require no lubrication.</p>

<p>Steam is usually worked at from 250 to 450 pounds, and
is generated in boilers composed of small tubes three inches
in diameter and three-eighths of an inch thick, which are
tested under a pressure of 2,500 pounds per square inch.
The safety-valve is usually loaded to 400 pounds. The
boiler is fed with distilled water, obtained principally by
condensation of the exhaust-steam, any deficiency being
made up by the addition of water from a distilling apparatus.
Under these conditions, but 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pound of coal is
consumed per hour and per horse-power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pumping-Engine</span> in use at the present time has
passed through a series of changes not differing much from
that which has been traced with the stationary mill-engine.
The Cornish engine is still used to some extent for supplying
water to towns, and is retained at deep mines. The
modern Cornish engine differs very little from that of the
time of Watt, except in the proportions of parts and the
form of its details. Steam-pressures are carried which were
never reached during the preceding period, and, by careful
adjustment of well-set and well-proportioned valves and
gearing, the engine has been made to work rather more rapidly,
and to do considerably more work. It still remains,
however, a large, costly, and awkward contrivance, requiring
expensive foundations, and demanding exceptional care,
skill, and experience in management. It is gradually going
out of use. This engine, as now constructed by good
builders, is shown in section in <a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a>.</p>

<p>A comparison with the Watt engine of a century earlier
will at once enable any one to appreciate the extent to
which changes may be made in perfecting a machine, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
after it has become complete, so far as supplying it with
all essential parts can complete it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig101" id="Fig101"></a>
<img src="images/illo356.png" alt="Cornish Pumping-Engine" width="400" height="447" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;Cornish Pumping-Engine, 1880.</p></div>

<p>In the figure, <i>A</i> is the cylinder, taking steam from the
boiler through the steam-passage, <i>M</i>. The steam is first
admitted above the piston, <i>B</i>, driving it rapidly downward
and raising the pump-rod, <i>E</i>. At an early period in the
stroke the admission of steam is checked by the sudden
closing of the induction-valve at <i>M</i>, and the stroke is completed
under the action of expanding steam assisted by the
inertia of the heavy parts already in motion. The necessary
weight and inertia is afforded, in many cases, where
the engine is applied to the pumping of deep mines, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
immensely long and heavy pump-rods. Where this weight
is too great, it is counterbalanced, and where too small,
weights are added. When the stroke is completed, the
&#8220;equilibrium valve&#8221; is opened, and the steam passes from
above to the space below the piston, and an equilibrium of
pressure being thus produced, the pump-rods descend, forcing
the water from the pumps and raising the steam-piston.
The absence of the crank, or other device which might determine
absolutely the length of stroke, compels a very
careful adjustment of steam-admission to the amount of
load. Should the stroke be allowed to exceed the proper
length, and should danger thus arise of the piston striking
the cylinder-head, <i>N</i>, the movement is checked by buffer-beams.
The valve-motion is actuated by a plug-rod, <i>J K</i>,
as in Watt&#8217;s engine. The regulation is effected by a &#8220;cataract,&#8221;
a kind of hydraulic governor, consisting of a plunger-pump,
with a reservoir attached. The plunger is raised by
the engine, and then automatically detached. It falls with
greater or less rapidity, its velocity being determined by
the size of the eduction-orifice, which is adjustable by hand.
When the plunger reaches the bottom of the pump-barrel,
it disengages a catch, a weight is allowed to act upon the
steam-valve, opening it, and the engine is caused to make a
stroke. When the outlet of the cataract is nearly closed,
the engine stands still a considerable time while the plunger
is descending, and the strokes succeed each other at long
intervals. When the opening is greater, the cataract acts
more rapidly, and the engine works faster. This has been
regarded until recently as the most economical of pumping-engines,
and it is still generally used in freeing mines of
water, and in situations where existing heavy pump-rods
may be utilized in counterbalancing the steam-pressure,
and, by their inertia, in continuing the motion after the
steam, by its expansion, has become greatly reduced in
pressure.</p>

<p>In this engine a gracefully-shaped and strong beam, <i>D</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
has taken the place of the ruder beam of the earlier period,
and is carried on a well-built wall of masonry, <i>R</i>. <i>F</i> is the
exhaust-valve, by which the steam passes to the condenser,
<i>G</i>, beside which is the air-pump, <i>H</i>, and the hot-well, <i>I</i>.
The cylinder is steam-jacketed, <i>P</i>, and protected against
losses of heat by radiation by a brick wall, <i>O</i>, the whole
resting on a heavy foundation, <i>Q</i>.</p>

<p>The Bull Cornish engine is also still not infrequently
seen in use. The Cornish engine of Great Britain averages
a duty of about 45,000,000 pounds raised one foot high per
100 pounds of coal. More than double this economy has
sometimes been attained.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig102" id="Fig102"></a>
<img src="images/illo358.png" alt="Steam Pump" width="400" height="297" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span>&mdash;Steam-Pump.</p></div>

<p>A vastly simpler form of pumping-engine without fly-wheel
is the now common &#8220;direct-acting steam-pump.&#8221;
This engine is generally made use of in feeding steam-boilers,
as a forcing and fire pump, and wherever the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
amount of water to be moved is not large, and where the
pressure is comparatively great. The steam-cylinder, <i>A R</i>,
and feed-pump, <i>B Q</i> (<a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a>), are in line, and the two
pistons have usually one rod, <i>D</i>, in common. The two cylinders
are connected by a strong frame, <i>N</i>, and two standards
fitted with lugs carry the whole, and serve as a means
of bolting the pump to the floor or to its foundation.</p>

<p>The method of working the steam-valve of the modern
steam-pump is ingenious and peculiar. As shown, the pistons
are moving toward the left; when they reach the end
of their stroke, the face of the piston strikes a pin or other
contrivance, and thus moves a small auxiliary valve, <i>I</i>,
which opens a port, <i>E</i>, and causes steam to be admitted behind
a piston, or permits steam to be exhausted, as in the
figure, from before the auxiliary piston, <i>F</i>, and the pressure
within the main steam-chest then forces that piston over,
moving the main steam-valve, <i>G</i>, to which it is attached,
admitting steam to the left-hand side of the main piston,
and exhausting on the right-hand side, <i>A</i>. Thus the motion
of the engine operates its own valves in such a manner
that it is never liable to stop working at the end of the stroke,
notwithstanding the absence of the crank and fly-wheel, or
of independent mechanism, like the cataract of the Cornish
engine. There is a very considerable variety of pumps of
this class, all differing in detail, but all presenting the distinguishing
feature of auxiliary valve and piston, and a
connection by which it and the main engine each works the
valve of the other combination.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig103" id="Fig103"></a>
<img src="images/illo360.png" alt="Section Worthinton Pumping-Engine" width="547" height="390" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span>&mdash;The Worthington Pumping-Engine, 1876. Section.</p></div>

<p>In some cases these pumps are made of considerable
size, and are applied to the elevation of water in situations
to which the Cornish engine was formerly considered exclusively
applicable. The accompanying <a href="#Fig103">figure</a> illustrates such
a pumping-engine, as built for supplying cities with water.
This is a &#8220;compound&#8221; direct-acting pumping-engine. The
cylinders, <i>A B</i>, are placed in line, working one pump, <i>F</i>,
and operating their own air-pumps, <i>D D</i>, by a bell-crank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
lever, <i>L H</i>, connected to the pump-buckets by links, <i>I K</i>.
Steam exhausted from the small cylinder, <i>A</i>, is further expanded
in the large cylinder, <i>B</i>, and thence goes to the
condenser, <i>C</i>. The valves, <i>N M</i>, are moved by the valve-gear,
<i>L</i>, which is actuated by the piston-rod of a similar
pair of cylinders placed by the side of the first. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
valves are balanced, and the balance-plates, <i>R Q</i>, are suspended
from the rods, <i>O P</i>, which allow them to move with
the valves. By connecting the valves of each engine with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the piston-rod of the other, it is seen that the two engines
must work alternately, the one making a stroke while the
other is still, and then itself stopping a moment while the
latter makes its stroke.</p>

<p>Water enters the pump through the induction-pipe, <i>E</i>,
passes into the pump-barrel through the valves, <i>V V</i>, and
issues through the eduction-valves, <i>T T</i>, and goes on to the
&#8220;mains&#8221; by the pipe, <i>G</i>, above which is seen an air-chamber,
which assists to preserve a uniform pressure on that
side the pump. This engine works very smoothly and
quietly, is cheap and durable, and has done excellent duty.</p>

an engine of the latter form.</p>

<p><i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are the two steam-cylinders, connected by
links and parallel motion, <i>C D</i>, to the great cast-iron beam,
<i>E F</i>. At the opposite end of the beam, the connecting-rod,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
<i>G</i>, turns a crank, <i>H</i>, and fly-wheel, <i>L M</i>, which regulates
the motion of the engine and controls the length of
stroke, averting all danger of accident occurring in consequence
of the piston striking either cylinder-head. The
beam is carried on handsomely-shaped iron columns, which,
with cylinders, pump, and fly-wheel, are supported by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
substantial stone foundation. The pump-rod, <i>I</i>, works a
double-acting pump, <i>J</i>, and the resistance to the issuing
water is rendered uniform by an air-chamber, <i>K</i>, within
which the water rises and falls when pressures tend to vary
greatly. A revolving shaft, <i>N</i>, driven from the fly-wheel
shaft, carries cams, <i>O P</i>, which move the lifting-rods seen
directly over them and the valves which they actuate. Between
the steam-cylinders and the columns which carry the
beams is a well, in which are placed the condenser and air-pump.
Steam is carried at 60 or 80 pounds pressure, and
expanded from 6 to 10 times.</p>

<p>A later form of double-cylinder beam pumping-engine
is that invented and designed by E. D. Leavitt, Jr., for the
Lawrence Water-Works, and shown in <a href="#Fig106">Figs. 106</a> and <a href="#Fig107">107</a>.
The two cylinders are placed one on each side the centre of
the beam, and are so inclined that they may be coupled to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
opposite ends of it, while their lower ends are placed close
together. At their upper ends a valve is placed at each
end of the connecting steam-pipe. At their lower ends a
single valve serves as exhaust-valve to the high-pressure
and as steam-valve to the low-pressure cylinder. The pistons
move in opposite directions, and steam is exhausted
from the high-pressure cylinder directly into the nearer end
of the low-pressure cylinder. The pump, of the &#8220;Thames-Ditton&#8221;
or &#8220;bucket-and-plunger&#8221; variety, takes a full supply
of water on the down-stroke, and discharges half when
rising and half when descending again. The duty of this
engine is reported by a board of engineers as 103,923,215
foot-pounds for every 100 pounds of coal burned. The
duty of a moderately good engine is usually considered to
be from 60 to 70 millions. This engine has steam-cylinders
of 17<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> and 36 inches diameter respectively, with a stroke of
7 feet. The pump had a capacity of about 195 gallons,
and delivered 96 per cent. Steam was carried at a pressure
of 75 pounds above the atmosphere, and was expanded
about 10 times. Plain horizontal tubular boilers were used,
evaporating 8.58 pounds of water from 98&deg; Fahr. per pound
of coal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steam-boilers.</span>&mdash;The steam supplied to the forms of
stationary engine which have been described is generated in
steam-boilers of exceedingly varied forms. The type used
is determined by the extent to which their cost is increased
in the endeavor to economize fuel by the pressure of steam
carried, by the greater or less necessity of providing against
risk of explosion, by the character of the feed-water to be
used, by the facilities which may exist for keeping in good
repair, and even by the character of the men in whose
hands the apparatus is likely to be placed.</p>

<p>As has been seen, the changes which have marked the
growth and development of the steam-engine have been
accompanied by equally marked changes in the forms of
the steam-boiler. At first, the same vessel served the distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
purposes of steam-generator and steam-engine. Later,
it became separated from the engine, and was then specially
fitted to perform its own peculiar functions; and its form
went through a series of modifications under the action of
the causes already stated.</p>

<p>When steam began to be usefully applied, and considerable
pressures became necessary, the forms given to boilers
were approximately spherical, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical.
Thus the boilers of De Caus (1615) and of the Marquis of
Worcester (1663) were spherical and cylindrical; those of
Savery (1698) were ellipsoidal and cylindrical. After the
invention of the steam-engine of Newcomen, the pressures
adopted were again very low, and steam-boilers were given
irregular forms until, at the beginning of the present century,
they were again of necessity given stronger shapes.
The material was at first frequently copper; it is now usually
wrought-iron, and sometimes steel.</p>

<p>The present forms of steam-boilers may be classified as
plain, flue, and tubular boilers. The plain cylindrical or
common cylinder boiler is the only representative of the first
class in common use. It is perfectly cylindrical, with heads
either flat or hemispherical. There is usually attached
to the boiler a &#8220;steam-drum&#8221; (a small cylindrical vessel),
from which the steam is taken by the steam-pipe. This enlargement
of the steam-space permits the mist, held in suspension
by the steam when it first rises from the surface of
the water, to separate more or less completely before the
steam is taken from the boiler.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 108.</span>&mdash;Babcock &amp; Wilcox&#8217;s Vertical Boiler.</p></div>

<p>Flue-boilers are frequently cylindrical, and contain one
or more cylindrical flues, which pass through from end to
end, beneath the water-line, conducting the furnace-gases,
and affording a greater area of heating-surface than can be
obtained in the plain boiler. They are usually from 30 to
48 inches in diameter, and one foot or less in length for
each inch of diameter. Some are, however, made 100 feet
and more in length. The boiler is made of iron
<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>
to <span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span>
of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
inch in thickness, with hemispherical or carefully stayed
flat heads, and without flues. The whole is placed in a
brickwork setting. These boilers are used where fuel is
inexpensive, where the cost of repairing would be great, or
where the feed-water is impure. A cylindrical boiler, having
one flue traversing it longitudinally, is called a Cornish
boiler, as it is generally supposed to have been first used in
Cornwall. It was probably first invented by Oliver Evans
in the United States, previous to 1786, at which time he
had it in use. The flue has usually a diameter 0.5 or 0.6
the diameter of the boiler. A boiler containing two longitudinal
flues is called the Lancashire boiler. This form
was also introduced by Oliver Evans. The flues have one-third
the diameter of the boiler. Several flues of smaller
diameter are often used, and when a still greater proportional
area of heating-surface is required, tubes of from 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>
inch to 4 or 5 inches in diameter are substituted for flues.
The flues are usually constructed by riveting sheets together,
as in making the shell or outer portion. They are
sometimes welded by British manufacturers, but rarely if
ever in the United States. Tubes are always &#8220;lap-welded&#8221;
in the process of rolling them. Small tubes were first used
in the United States, about 1785. In portable, locomotive,
and marine steam-boilers, the fire must be built within the
boiler itself, instead of (as in the above described stationary
boilers) in a furnace of brickwork exterior to the boiler.
The flame and gases from the furnace or fire-box in these
kinds of boiler are never led through brick passages en
route to the chimney, as often in the preceding case, but
are invariably conducted through flues or tubes, or both, to
the smoke-stack. These boilers are also sometimes used as
stationary boilers. <a href="#Fig108">Fig. 108</a> represents such a steam-boiler
in section, as it is usually exhibited in working drawings.
Provision is made to secure a good circulation of water in
these boilers by means of the &#8220;baffle-plates,&#8221; seen in the
sketch, which compel the water to flow as indicated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
arrows. The tubes are frequently made of brass or of copper,
to secure rapid transmission of heat to the water, and
thus to permit the use of a smaller area of heating-surface
and a smaller boiler. The steam-space is made as large as
possible, to secure immunity from &#8220;priming&#8221; or the &#8220;entrainment&#8221;
of water with the steam. This type of steam-boiler,
invented by Nathan Read, of Salem, Mass., in 1791,
and patented in April of that year, was the earliest of the
tubular boilers. In the locomotive boiler (<a href="#Fig109">Fig. 109</a>), as in
the preceding, the characteristics are a fire-box at one end
of the shell and a set of tubes through which the gases pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
directly to the smoke-stack. Strength, compactness, great
steaming capacity, fair economy, moderate cost, and convenience
of combination with the running parts, are secured
by the adoption of this form. It is frequently used also
for portable and stationary engines. It was invented in
France by M. Seguin, and in England by Booth, and used
by George Stephenson at about the same time&mdash;1828 or
1829.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span>&mdash;Stationary &#8220;Locomotive&#8221; Boiler.</p></div>

<p>Since the efficiency of a steam-boiler depends upon the
extent of effective heating-surface per unit of weight of
fuel burned in any given time&mdash;or, ordinarily, upon the
ratio of the areas of heating and grate surface&mdash;peculiar
expedients are sometimes adopted, having for their object
the increase of heating-surface, without change of form of
boiler and without proportionate increase of cost.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="Fig110" id="Fig110">
</a><img src="images/illo370.png" alt="Galloway Conical Tube" width="300" height="153" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span></p></div>

<p>One of these methods is that of the use of Galloway
conical tubes (<a href="#Fig110">Fig. 110</a>). These are very largely
used in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Great Britain, but are seldom if ever seen in the United
States. The Cornish boiler, to which they are usually applied,
consists of a large cylindrical shell, 6 feet or more in
diameter, containing one tube of
about one-half as great dimensions,
or sometimes two of one-third
the diameter of the shell
each. Such boilers have a very
small ratio of heating to grate
surface, and their large tubes are
peculiarly liable to collapse. To remove these objections,
the Messrs. Galloway introduced stay-tubes into the flues,
which tubes are conical in form, and are set in either a vertical
or an inclined position, the larger end uppermost.
The area of heating-surface is thus greatly increased, and,
at the same time, the liability to collapse is reduced. The
same results are obtained by another device of Galloway,
which is sometimes combined with that just described in
the same boiler. Several sheets in the flue have &#8220;pockets&#8221;
worked into them, which pockets project into the flue-passage.</p>

<p>Another device is that of an American engineer, Miller,
who surrounds the furnace of cylindrical and other boilers
with water-tubes. The &#8220;fuel-economizers&#8221; of Greene and
others consist of similar collections of tubes set in the flues,
between the boiler and the chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sectional</i>&#8221; boilers are gradually coming into use with
high pressures, on account of their greater safety against
disastrous explosions. The earliest practicable example of
a boiler of this class was probably that of Colonel John Stevens,
of Hoboken, N. J. Dr. Alban, who, forty years later,
attempted to bring this type into general use, and constructed
a number of such boilers, did not succeed. Their
introduction, like that of all radical changes in engineering,
has been but slow, and it has been only recently that their
manufacture has become an important branch of industry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>A committee of the American Institute, of which the
author was chairman, in 1871, examined several boilers of
this and the ordinary type, and tested them very carefully.
They reported that they felt &#8220;confident that the introduction
of this class of steam-boilers will do much toward the
removal of the cause of that universal feeling of distrust
which renders the presence of a steam-boiler so objectionable
in every locality. The difficulties in thoroughly inspecting
these boilers, in regulating their action, and other
faults of the class, are gradually being overcome, and the
committee look forward with confidence to the time when
their use will become general, to the exclusion of older and
more dangerous forms of steam-boilers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The economical performance of these boilers with a similar
ratio of heating to grate surface is equal to that of
other kinds. In fact, they are usually given a somewhat
higher ratio, and their economy of fuel frequently exceeds
that of the other types. Their principal defect is their
small capacity for steam and water, which makes it extremely
difficult to obtain steady steam-pressure. Where
they are employed, the feed and draught should be, if possible,
controlled by automatic attachments, and the feed-water
heated to the highest attainable temperature. Their
satisfactory working depends, more than in other cases, on
the ability of the fireman, and can only be secured by the
exercise of both care and skill.</p>

<p>Many forms of these boilers have been devised. Walter
Hancock constructed boilers for his steam-carriage of
flat plates connected by stay-bolts, several such sections
composing the boiler; and about the same time (1828) Sir
Goldsworthy Gurney constructed for a similar purpose boilers
consisting of a steam and a water reservoir, placed one
above the other, and connected by triangularly-bent water-tubes
exposed to the heat of the furnace-gases. Jacob Perkins
made many experiments looking to the employment of
very high steam-pressures, and in 1831 patented a boiler of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
this class, in which the heating-surfaces nearest the fire were
composed of iron tubes, which tubes also served as grate-bars.
The steam and water space was principally comprised
within a comparatively large chamber, of which the
walls were secured by closely distributed stay-bolts. For
extremely high pressures, boilers composed only of tubes
were used. Dr. Ernst Alban described the boiler already
referred to, and its construction and operation, and stated
that he had experimented with pressures as high as 1,000
pounds to the square inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig111" id="Fig111"></a>
<img src="images/illo372.png" alt="Harrison's Sectional Boiler" width="385" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span>&mdash;Harrison&#8217;s Sectional Boiler.</p></div>

<p>The Harrison steam-boiler, which has been many years
in use in the United States, consists of several sections, each
of which is made up of hollow globes of cast-iron, communicating
with each other by necks cast upon the spheres,
and fitted together with faced joints. Long bolts, extending
from end to end of each row, bind the spheres together.
(<i>See</i> <a href="#Fig111">Fig. 111</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig112" id="Fig112"></a>
<img src="images/illo373.png" alt="Babcock &amp; Wilcock's Sectionasl Boiler" width="450" height="286" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.</span>&mdash;Babcock and Wilcox&#8217;s Sectional Boiler.</p></div>

<p>An example of another modern type in extensive use is
given in <a href="#Fig112">Fig. 112</a>, a semi-sectional boiler, which consists of
a series of inclined wrought-iron tubes, connected by T-heads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
which form the vertical water-channels, at each end.
The joints are faced by milling them, and then ground so
perfectly tight that a pressure of 500 pounds to the square
inch is insufficient to produce leakage. No packing is used.
The fire is made under the front and higher end of the
tubes, and the products of combustion pass up between the
tubes into a combustion-chamber under the steam and water
drum; hence they pass down between the tubes, then once
more up through the space between the tubes, and off to
the chimney. The steam is taken out at the top of the
steam-drum near the back end of the boiler. The rapid
circulation prevents to some extent the formation of deposits
or incrustations upon the heating-surfaces, sweeping
them away and depositing them in the mud-drum, whence
they are blown out. Rapid circulation of water, as has
been shown by Prof. Trowbridge, also assists in the extraction
of the heat from the gases, by the presentation
of fresh water continually, as well as by the prevention of
incrustation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>Attempts have been made to adapt sectional boilers to
marine engines; but very little progress has yet been made
in their introduction. The Root sectional boiler (<a href="#Fig113">Fig. 113</a>),
an American design, which is in extensive use in the United
States and Europe, has also been experimentally placed in
service on shipboard. Its heating-surface consists wholly
of tubes, which are connected by a peculiarly formed
series of caps; the joints are made tight with rubber
&#8220;grummets.&#8221;</p>


<hr class="c05" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Portable and Locomotive Engines.</span></h4>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>Engines and boilers, when of small size, are now often
combined in one structure which may be readily transported.
Where they have a common base-plate simply, as in
<a href="#Fig114">Fig. 114</a>, they are called, usually, &#8220;semi-portable engines.&#8221;
These little engines have some decided advantages. Being
attached to one base, the combined engine and boiler is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
easily transported, occupies little space, and may very
readily be mounted upon wheels, rendering it peculiarly
well adapted for agricultural purposes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig114" id="Fig114"></a>
<img src="images/illo375.png" alt="Semi-Portable Engine" width="350" height="431" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span>&mdash;Semi-Portable Engine, 1878.</p></div>

<p>The example here shown differs in its design from those
usually seen in the market. The engine is not fastened to
or upon the boiler, and is therefore not affected by expansion,
nor are the bearings overheated by conduction or by
ascending heat from the boiler. The fly-wheel is at the
base, which arrangement secures steadiness at the high
speed which is a requisite for economy of fuel. The boilers
are of the upright tubular style, with internal fire-box,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and are intended to be worked at 150 pounds pressure per
inch. They are fitted with a baffle-plate and circulating-pipe,
to prevent priming, and also with a fusible plug, which will
melt and prevent the crown-sheet of the boiler burning, if
the water gets low.</p>

<p>Another illustration of this form of engine, as built in
small sizes, is seen <a href="#Fig115">below</a>. The peculiarity of this engine
is, that the cylinder is placed in the top of the boiler, which
is upright. By this arrangement the engine is constantly
drawing from the boiler the hottest and driest steam, and
there is thus no liability of serious loss by condensation,
which is rapid, even in a short pipe, when the engine is
separate from the boiler.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig115" id="Fig115"></a>
<img src="images/illo376.png" alt="Semi-Portable Engine" width="208" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span>&mdash;Semi-Portable Engine, 1878.</p></div>

<p>The engine illustrated is rated at 10 horse-power, and
makers are always expected to guarantee their machines to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
work up to the rated power. The cylinder is 7 by 7 inches,
and the main shaft is directly over it. On this shaft are
three eccentrics, one working the pump, one moving the
valves, and the third one operating the cut-off. The driving-pulley
is 20 inches in diameter, and the balance-wheel
30 inches. The boiler has 15 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>-inch flues. It is furnished
with a heater in its lower portion. The boiler of this engine
is tested up to 200 pounds, and is calculated to carry
100 pounds working pressure, though that is not necessary
to develop the full power of the engine. The compactness
of the whole machine is exceptional. It can be set up in a
space 5 feet square and 8 feet high. The weight of the 10
horse-power engine is 1,540 pounds, and of the whole machine
4,890 pounds, boxed for shipment. Every part of the
mechanism usually fits and works with the exactness of a
gun-lock, as each piece is carefully made to gauge.</p>

<p>Portable engines are those which are especially intended
to be moved conveniently from place to place. The engine
is usually attached to the boiler, and the feed-pump is generally
attached to the engine. The whole machine is carried
on wheels, and is moved from one place to another,
usually by horses, but sometimes by its own engine, which
is coupled by an engaging and disengaging apparatus to
the rear-wheels. English builders have usually excelled in
the construction of this class of steam-engine, although it is
probable that the best American engines are fully equal to
them in design, material, and construction.</p>

<p>The later work of the best-known English builders has
given economical results that have surprised engineers.
The annual &#8220;shows&#8221; of the Royal Agricultural Society
have elicited good evidence of skill in management as well
as of excellence of design and construction. Some little
portable engines have exhibited an economical efficiency
superior to that of the largest marine engines of any but
the compound type, and even closely competing with that
form. The causes of this remarkable economy are readily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
learned by an inspection of these engines, and by observation
of the method of managing them at the test-trial.
The engines are usually very carefully designed. The cylinders
are nicely proportioned to their work, and their pistons
travel at high speed. Their valve-gear consists usually
of a plain slide-valve, supplemented by a separate expansion-slide,
driven by an independent eccentric, and capable
of considerable variation in the point of cut-off. This form
of expansion-gear is very effective&mdash;almost as much so as a
drop cut-off&mdash;at the usual grade of expansion, which is not
far from four times. The governor is usually attached to a
throttle-valve in the steam-pipe, an arrangement which is
not the best possible under variable loads, but which produces
no serious loss of efficiency when the engine is driven,
as at competitive trials, under the very uniform load of a
Prony strap-brake and at very nearly the maximum capacity
of the machine. The most successful engines have had
steam-jacketed cylinders&mdash;always an essential to maximum
economy&mdash;with high steam and a considerable expansion.
The boilers are strongly made, and are, as are also
all other heated surfaces, carefully clothed with non-conducting
material, and well lagged over all. The details
are carefully proportioned, the rods and frames are strong
and well secured together, and the bearings have large rubbing-surfaces.
The connecting-rods are long and easy-working,
and every part is capable of doing its work without
straining and with the least friction.</p>

<p>In handling the engines at the competitive trial, most
experienced and skillful drivers are selected. The difference
between the performances of the same engine in different
hands has been found to amount to from 10 to 15 per cent.,
even where the competitors were both considered exceptionally
skillful men. In manipulating the engine, the fires
are attended to with the utmost care; coal is thrown upon
them at regular and frequent intervals, and a uniform depth
of fuel and a perfectly clean fire are secured. The sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and corners of the fire are looked after with especial care.
The fire-doors are kept open the least possible time; not a
square inch of grate-surface is left unutilized, and every
pound of coal gives out its maximum of calorific power, and
in precisely the place where it is needed. Feed-water is
supplied as nearly as possible continuously, and with the
utmost regularity. In some cases the engine-driver stands
by his engine constantly, feeding the fire with coal in handfuls,
and supplying the water to the heater by hand by
means of a cup. Heaters are invariably used in such cases.
The exhaust is contracted no more than is absolutely necessary
for draught. The brake is watched carefully, lest
irregularity of lubrication should cause oscillation of speed
with the changing resistance. The load is made the maximum
which the engine is designed to drive with economy.
Thus all conditions are made as favorable as possible to
economy, and they are preserved as invariable as the utmost
care on the part of the attendant can make them.</p>

<p>These trials are usually of only three or five hours&#8217; duration,
and thus terminate before it becomes necessary to
clean fires. The following are results obtained at the trial
of engines which took place in July, 1870, at the Oxford
Agricultural Fair:</p>

<p>With all these engines steam-jackets were used; the
feed-water was highly and uniformly heated by exhaust-steam;
the coal was selected, finely broken, and thrown on
the fire with the greatest care; the velocity of the engines,
the steam-pressure, and the amount of feed-water,
were very carefully regulated, and all bearings were run
quite loose; the engine-drivers were usually expert &#8220;jockeys.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next <a href="#Fig116">illustration</a> represents the portable steam-engine
as built by one of the oldest and most experienced
manufacturers of such engines in the United States.</p>

<p>In the boilers of these engines the heating-surface is
given less extent than in the stationary engine-boiler, but
much greater than in the locomotive, and varies from 10 to
20 square feet per horse-power. The boilers are made very
strong, to enable them to withstand the strains due to the
attached engine, which are estimated as equivalent to from
one-tenth to one-fifth that due to the steam-pressure. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
boiler is sometimes given even double the strength usual
with stationary boilers of similar capacity. The engine is
mounted, in this example, directly over the boiler, and all
parts are in sight and readily accessible to the engineer.</p>

<p>One of these engines, of 20 horse-power, has a steam-cylinder
10 inches in diameter and 18 inches stroke of piston,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
making 125 revolutions per minute, and has 9 square
feet of grate-surface and 288 feet of heating-surface. It
weighs about 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons. Steam is carried at 125 pounds.</p>

<p>In the class of engines just described, the draught is
obtained by the blast of the exhaust-steam which is led
into the chimney. Such engines are now sold at from $120
to $150 per horse-power, according to size and quality, the
smaller engines costing most. The usual consumption of
fuel is from 4 to 6 pounds per hour and per horse-power,
burning from 15 to 20 pounds on each square foot of grate,
and each pound evaporating about 8 pounds of water. A
usual weight is, for the larger sizes, 500 pounds per horse-power.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 117.</span>&mdash;The Thrashers&#8217; Road-Engine, 1878.</p></div>

<p>These engines are sometimes arranged to propel themselves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
as in the Mills &#8220;Thrashers&#8217;&#8221; road-engine or locomotive,
of which the accompanying <a href="#Fig117">engraving</a> is a good representation.
This engine is proportioned for hauling a tank
containing 10 barrels, or more, of water and a grain-separator
over all ordinary roads, and to drive a thrashing-machine
or saw-mill, developing 20 or 25 horse-power. This
example of the road-engine has a boiler built to work at
250 pounds of steam; the engine is designed for a maximum
power of 30 horses.</p>

<p>This engine has a balanced valve and automatic cut-off,
and is fitted with a reversing-gear for use on the road.
The driving-wheels are of wrought-iron, 56 inches diameter
and 8 inches wide, with cast-iron driving-arms. Both
wheels are drivers on curves as well as on straight lines.
The engine is guided and fired by one man, and the total
weight is so small that it will pass safely over any good
country bridge. A brake is attached, to insure safety when
going down-hill. Although designed to move at a speed
of about three miles per hour, the velocity of the piston
may be increased so that four miles per hour may be accomplished
when necessary.</p>

<p>This is an excellent example of this kind of engine as
constructed at the present time. The strongly-built boiler,
with its heater, the jacketed cylinder, and light, strong
frame of the engine, the steel running-gear, the carefully-covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
surfaces of cylinder and boiler, and excellent proportions
of details, are illustrations of good modern engineering,
and are in curious contrast with the first of the
class, built a century earlier by Smeaton.</p>

<p>The boiler was of the ordinary locomotive type, and
the engine was mounted upon it, as is usual with portable
engines.</p>

<p>The steam-cylinder was steam-jacketed, in accordance
with the most advanced practice here and abroad. The
crank-shaft and other wrought-iron parts subjected to heavy
strains were strong and plainly finished. The gearing was
of malleableized cast-iron, and all bearings, from crank-shaft
to driving-wheel, on each side, were carried by a single
sheet of half-inch plate, which also formed the sides of
the fire-box exterior.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the conclusions deduced
by the author from the trial, and published in the <i>Journal
of the Franklin Institute</i>: A traction-engine may be so
constructed as to be easily and rapidly man&oelig;uvred on the
common road; and an engine weighing over 5 tons may be
turned continuously without difficulty on a circle of 18 feet
radius, or even on a road but little wider than the length
of the engine. A locomotive of 5 tons 4 hundredweight
has been constructed, capable of drawing on a good road
23,000 pounds up a grade of 533 feet to the mile, at the rate
of four miles an hour; and one might be constructed to
draw more than 63,000 pounds up a grade of 225 feet to
the mile, at the rate of two miles an hour.</p>

<p>It was further shown that the coefficient of traction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
with heavily-laden wagons on a good macadamized road
is not far from .04; the traction-power of this engine is
equal to that of 20 horses; the weight, exclusive of the
weight of the engine, that could be drawn on a level road,
was 163,452 pounds; and the amount of fuel required is
estimated at 500 pounds a day. The advantages claimed
for the traction-engine over horse-power are: no necessity
for a limitation of working-hours; a difference in first cost
in favor of steam; and in heavy work on a common road
the expense by steam is less than 25 per cent. of the average
cost of horse-power, a traction-engine capable of doing the
work of 25 horses being worked at as little expense as 6 or
8 horses. The cost of hauling heavy loads has been estimated
at 7 cents per ton per mile.</p>

<p>Such engines are gradually becoming useful in steam-ploughing.
Two systems are adopted. In the one the engine
is stationary, and hauls a &#8220;gang&#8221; of ploughs by means
of a windlass and wire rope; in the other the engine traverses
a field, drawing behind it a plough or a gang of
ploughs. The latter method has been proposed for breaking
up prairie-land.</p>

<p>Thus, thirty years after the defeat of the intelligent,
courageous, and persistent Hancock and his coworkers in
the scheme of applying the steam-engine usefully on the
common road, we find strong indications that, in a new
form, the problem has been again attacked, and at least
partially solved.</p>

<p>One of the most important of the prerequisites to ultimate
success in the substitution of steam for animal power
on the highway is that our roads shall be well made. As
the greatest care and judgment are exercised, and an immense
outlay of capital is considered justifiable, in securing
easy grades and a smooth track on our railroad routes, we
may readily believe that similar precaution and outlay will
be found advisable in adapting the common road to the
road-locomotive. It would seem to the engineer that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
natural obstacles generally supposed to stand in the way
have, after all, no real existence. The principal inconvenience
that may be anticipated will probably arise from the
carelessness or avarice of proprietors, which may sometimes
cause them to appoint ignorant and inefficient engine-drivers,
giving them charge of what are always excellent servants,
but terrible masters. Nevertheless, as the transportation
of passengers on railroads is found to be attended
with less liability to loss of life or injury of person than
their carriage by stage-coach, it will be found, very probably,
that the general use of steam in transporting freight
on common roads may be attended with less risk to life or
property than to-day attends the use of horse-power.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Steam Fire-Engine</span> is still another form of portable
engine. It is also one of the latest of all applications of
steam-power. The steam fire-engine is peculiarly an American
production. Although previously attempted, their
permanently successful introduction has only occurred within
the last fifteen years.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>&mdash;The Latta Steam Fire-Engine.</p></div>

<p>As early as 1830, Braithwaite and Ericsson, of London,
England, built an engine with steam and pump cylinders of
7 and 6<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches diameter, respectively, with 16 inches stroke
of piston. This machine weighed 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> tons, and is said to have
thrown 150 gallons of water per minute to a height of between
80 and 100 feet. It was ready for work in about 20
minutes after lighting the fire. Braithwaite afterward supplied
a more powerful engine to the King of Prussia, in
1832. The first attempt made in the United States to construct
a steam fire-engine was probably that of Hodge, who
built one in New York in 1841. It was a strong and very effective
machine, but was far too heavy for rapid transportation.
The late J. K. Fisher, who throughout his life persistently
urged the use of steam-carriages and traction-engines,
designing and building several, also planned a steam fire-engine.
Two were built from his design by the Novelty
Works, New York, about 1860, for Messrs. Lee &amp; Larned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
They were &#8220;self-propellers,&#8221; and one of them, built for the
city of Philadelphia, was sent to that city over the highway,
driven by its own engines. The other was built for and used
by the New York Fire Department, and did good service for
several years. These engines were heavy, but very powerful,
and were found to move at good speed under steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and to man&oelig;uvre well. The Messrs. Latta, of Cincinnati,
soon after succeeded in constructing comparatively light
and very effective engines, and the fire department of that
city was the first to adopt steam fire-engines definitely as
their principal reliance. This change has now become general.</p>

<p>The steam fire-engine has now entirely displaced the old
hand-engine in all large cities. It does its work at a fraction
of the cost of the latter. It can force its water to a
height of 225 feet, and to a distance of more than 300 feet
horizontally, while the hand-engine can seldom throw it
one-third these distances; and the &#8220;steamer&#8221; may be relied
upon to work at full power many hours if necessary, while
the men at the hand-engine soon become fatigued, and require
frequent relief. The city of New York has 40 steam
fire-engines. One engine to every 10,000 inhabitants is a
proper proportion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig121" id="Fig121"></a>
<img src="images/illo390.png" alt="Amoskeag Engine, Section" width="484" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 121.</span>&mdash;The Amoskeag Engine. Section.</p></div>

<p>In the standard steam fire-engine (<a href="#Fig120">Fig. 120</a>) reciprocating
engines and pumps are adopted, as seen in section in
<a href="#Fig121">Fig. 121</a>, in which <i>A</i> is the furnace, and <i>B</i> the set of closely-set
vertical fire-tubes in the boiler. <i>C</i> is the combustion-chamber,
<i>D</i> the smoke-pipe, and <i>R</i> the steam-space.
<i>E</i> is the steam-cylinder, and <i>F</i> the pump, which is seen to
be double-acting. There are two pairs of engines and
pumps, working on cranks, set at right angles, and turning
a balance-wheel seen behind them. <i>G</i> is the feed-pump
which supplies water to the boiler, <i>H</i> the air-chamber which
equalizes the water-pressure, which reaches it through the
pipe, <i>I J</i>. <i>K</i> is the feed-water tank, under the driver&#8217;s
seat, <i>L</i>, which, with the engines and boiler, are carried on
the frame, <i>M M</i>. The fireman stands on the platform, <i>N</i>.
When it is necessary to move the machine, an endless
chain connects the crank-shaft with the rear-wheels, and
the engine, with pumps shut off, is thus made to drive the
wheels at any desired speed.</p>

<p>A self-propelling engine by the Amoskeag Company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
had the following dimensions and performance: Weight, 4
tons; speed, 8 miles per hour; steam-pressure, 75 pounds
per square inch; height of stream from 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>-inch nozzle, 225
feet; 1<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>-inch nozzle,

nozzle, 300 feet; 1<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>-inch, 250 feet&mdash;a performance
which contrasts wonderfully with that of the hand-worked
fire-engine which these engines have now superseded.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig122" id="Fig122"></a>
<img src="images/illo391.png" alt="Silsby Rotary Steam Fire-Engine" width="553" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 122.</span>&mdash;The Silsby Rotary Steam Fire-Engine.</p></div>

<p>It has recently become common to construct the steam
fire-engine with rotary engine and pump (<a href="#Fig122">Fig. 122</a>). The
superiority of a rotary motion for a steam-engine is apparently
so evident that many attempts have been made to
overcome the practical difficulties to which it is subject.
One of these difficulties, and the principal one, has been the
packing of the part which performs the office of the piston
in the straight cylinder. Robert Stephenson once expressed
the opinion that a rotary engine would never be made to
work successfully, on account of this difficulty of packing.
The most palpable of the advantages of the rotary engine
are the reduction in the size of the engine, claimed to result
from the great velocity of the piston; the avoidance
of great accidental strains, especially noticed in propelling
ships; and a great saving of the power which is asserted to
be expended in the reciprocating engine in overcoming the
inertia while changing the direction of the motions. These
advantages adapt the rotary engine, in an especial manner,
to the driving of a locomotive or steam fire-engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig123" id="Fig123"></a>
<img src="images/illo392.png" alt="Rotary Steam-Engine" width="350" height="221" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.</span>&mdash;Rotary Steam-Engine.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig124" id="Fig124"></a>
<img src="images/illo393.png" alt="Rotary Pump" width="350" height="241" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.</span>&mdash;Rotary Pump.</p></div>

<p>In the Holly rotary engine, seen in <a href="#Fig123">Fig. 123</a>, eccentrics
and sliding-cams, which are frequently used in rotary engines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and which are objectionable on account of their great
friction, are avoided. Corrugated pistons, or irregular
cams, <i>C D</i>, are adopted, forming chambers within the cases.
In the engine the steam enters at <i>A</i>, at the bottom of the
case, and presses the cams apart. The only packing used
is in the ends of the long metal cogs, which are ground to
fit the case and are kept out by the momentum of the cams,
assisted by a slight spring back of the packing-pieces. The
friction on the pump (<a href="#Fig124">Fig. 124</a>) is said to be less than in
the engine. This is the reason given in support of the
claim that the rotary engine forces water to a given distance
with from one-fourth to one-third the steam-pressure
necessary to drive all reciprocating engines. The smaller
amount of power necessary to do the work, the less strain
and consequent wear and tear upon the whole machine, are
said to make it more durable and reliable. The pump being
chambered, its liability to injury by the use of dirty or
gritty water is lessened, and it is stated that it will last for
years, pumping gritty water that would soon cut out a piston-pump.
The pump used with this engine is, as shown in the
above illustration, somewhat similar to the rotary engine
driving it. Each of the revolving pistons has three long
teeth bearing against the cylinder, and packed, to prevent
leakage, like the engine-cams. They are carried on steel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
shafts coupled to the engine-shafts. The water enters at
<i>E</i> and is discharged at <i>F</i>, and the passages are purposely
made large in order that sand, chips, and dirt, which may
enter with the water, may pass through.</p>

<p>The rotary engine is gradually coming into use for various
special purposes, where small power is called for, and
where economy of fuel is not important; but it has never
yet competed, and may perhaps never in the future compete,
with the reciprocating-piston engine where large engines
are required, or where even moderate economy of fuel is
essential. This form of engine has assumed so little importance,
in fact, in the application of the steam-engine,
that comparatively little is known of its history. Watt invented
a rotary engine, and Yule many years afterward
(1836) constructed such engines at Glasgow. Lamb patented
another in 1842, Behrens still another in 1847. Napier,
Hall, Massey, Holly, La France, and others, have
built engines of this class in later times. Nearly all consist
either of cams rotating in gear, as in those above
sketched, or of a piston set radially in a cylinder of small
diameter, which turns on its axis within a much larger cylinder
set eccentrically, the piston, as the former turns, sliding
in and out of the smaller cylinder as its outer edge
slides in contact with the inner surface of the larger. In
some forms of rotary engine, a piston revolves on a central
shaft, and a sliding abutment in the external cylinder serves
to separate the steam from the exhaust side and to confine
the steam expanding while doing work. Nearly all of
these combinations are also used as pumps.</p>

<p>Fire-engines, made by the best-known American builders
of engines, with reciprocating engines and pumps, such
as are in general use in the United States, have become
standard in general plan and arrangement of details. These
are probably the best illustrations of extreme lightness,
combined with strength of parts and working power, which
have ever been produced in any branch of mechanical engineering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
By using a small boiler crowded with heating-surface,
very carefully proportioned and arranged, and
with small water-spaces; by adopting steel for running-gear
and working parts wherever possible; by working at
high piston-speed and with high steam-pressure; by selecting
fuel with extreme care&mdash;by all these expedients, the
steam fire-engine has been brought, in this country, to a
state of efficiency far superior to anything seen elsewhere.
Steam is raised with wonderful promptness, even from cold
water, and water is thrown from the nozzle at the end of
long lines of hose to great distances. But this combination
of lightness with power is only attained at the expense of
a certain regularity of action which can only be secured by
greater water and steam capacity in the boiler. The small
quantity of water contained within the boiler makes it necessary
to give constant attention to the feed, and the tendency,
almost invariably observed, to serious foaming and
priming not only compels unintermitted care while running,
but even introduces an element of danger which is not to
be despised, even though the machine be in charge of the
most experienced and skillful attendants. Even the greatest
care, directed by the utmost skill, would not avail to prevent
frequent explosions, were it not for the fact that it rarely,
if ever, happens that accidents to such boilers occur from
low water, unless the boiler is actually completely emptied
of water. In driving them at fires, they frequently foam so
violently that it is utterly impossible to obtain any clew to
the amount of water present, and the attendant usually
keeps his feed-pump on and allows the foaming to go on.
As long as water is passing into the boiler it is very unlikely
that any portion will become overheated and that accident
will occur. Such management appears very reckless, and
yet accident from such a cause is exceedingly rare.</p>

<p>The changes which have been made in <span class="smcap">Locomotive-Construction</span>
during the past few years have also been in
the direction of the refinement of the earlier designs, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
have been accompanied by corresponding changes in all
branches of railroad-work. The adjustment of parts to
each other and proportioning them to their work, the
modification of the minor details to suit changes of general
dimensions, the improvement of workmanship, and the
use of better material, have signalized this latest period.
Special forms of engine have been devised for special
kinds of work. Small, light tank-engines (<a href="#Fig125">Fig. 125</a>), carrying
their own fuel and water without &#8220;tenders,&#8221; are used
for moving cars about terminal stations and for making up
trains; powerful, heavy, slow-moving engines, of large
boiler-capacity and with small wheels, are used on steep
gradients and for hauling long trains laden with coal and
heavy merchandise; and hardly less powerful but quite
differently proportioned &#8220;express&#8221;-engines are used for
passenger and mail service.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.</span>&mdash;Forney&#8217;s Tank-Locomotive.</p></div>

<p>A peculiar form of engine (<a href="#Fig126">Fig. 126</a>) has been designed
by Forney, in which the whole weight of engine, tender,
coal, and water, is carried by one frame and on one set of
wheels, the permanent weight falling on the driving-wheels
and the variable load on the truck. These engines have also
a comparatively short wheel-base and high pulling-power.
The lightest tank-engines of the first class mentioned
weigh 8 or 10 tons; but engines much lighter than these,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
even, are built for mines, where they are sent into the galleries
to bring out the coal-laden wagons. The heaviest
engines of this class attain weights of 20 or 30 tons. The
heaviest engine yet constructed in the United States is said
to be one in use on the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
having a weight of about 100,000 pounds, which is carried
on 12 driving-wheels.</p>

<p>A locomotive has two steam-cylinders, either side by
side within the frame, and immediately beneath the forward
end of the boiler, or on each side and exterior to the frame.
The engines are non-condensing, and of the simplest possible
construction. The whole machine is carried upon strong but
flexible steel springs. The steam-pressure is usually more
than 100 pounds. The pulling-power is generally about one-fifth
the weight under most favorable conditions, and becomes
as low as one-tenth on wet rails. The fuel employed
is wood in new countries, coke in bituminous coal districts,
and anthracite coal in the eastern part of the United States.
The general arrangement and the proportions of locomotives
differ somewhat in different localities. In <a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a>, a British
express-engine, <i>O</i> is the boiler, <i>N</i> the fire-box, <i>X</i> the
grate, <i>G</i> the smoke-box, and <i>P</i> the chimney. <i>S</i> is a spring
and <i>R</i> a lever safety-valve, <i>T</i> is the whistle, <i>L</i> the throttle
or regulator valve, <i>E</i> the steam-cylinder, and <i>W</i> the driving-wheel.
The force-pump, <i>B C</i>, is driven from the cross-head,
<i>D</i>. The frame is the base of the whole system, and
all other parts are firmly secured to it. The boiler is made
fast at one end, and provision is made for its expansion
when heated. Adhesion is secured by throwing a proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
proportion of the weight upon the driving-wheel, <i>W</i>. This
is from about 6,000 pounds on standard freight-engines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
having several pairs of drivers, to 10,000 pounds on passenger-engines,
per axle. The peculiarities of the American
type (<a href="#Fig128">Fig. 128</a>) are the truck, <i>I J</i>, or bogie, supporting the
forward part of the engine, the system of equalizers, or
beams which distribute the weight of the machine equally
over the several axles, and minor differences of detail. The
cab or house, <i>r</i>, protecting the engine-driver and fireman, is
an American device, which is gradually coming into use
abroad also. The American locomotive is distinguished by
its flexibility and ease of action upon even roughly-laid
roads. In the sketch, which shows a standard American
engine in section, <i>A B</i> is the boiler, <i>C</i> one of the steam-cylinders,
<i>D</i> the piston, <i>E</i> the cross-head, connected to the
crank-shaft, <i>F</i>, by the connecting-rod, <i>G H</i> the driving-wheels,
<i>I J</i> the truck-wheels, carrying the truck, <i>K L</i>;
<i>N N</i> is the fire-box, <i>O O</i> the tubes, of which but four are
shown. The steam-pipe, <i>R S</i>, leads the steam to the valve-chest,
<i>T</i>, in which is seen the valve, moved by the valve-gear,
<i>U V</i>, and the link, <i>W</i>. The link is raised or depressed
by a lever, <i>X</i>, moved from the cab. The safety-valve
is seen at the top of the dome, at <i>Y</i>, and the spring-balance
by which the load is adjusted is shown at <i>Z</i>. At <i>a</i> is the
cone-shaped exhaust-pipe, by which a good draught is secured.
The attachments <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>&mdash;whistle, steam-gauge,
sand-box, bell, head-light, and &#8220;cow-catcher&#8221;&mdash;are
nearly all peculiar, either in construction or location, to the
American locomotive. The cost of passenger-locomotives
of ordinary size is about $12,000; heavier engines sometimes
cost $20,000. The locomotive is usually furnished
with a tender, which carries its fuel and water. The standard
passenger-engine on the Pennsylvania Railroad has four
driving-wheels, 5<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet diameter; steam-cylinders, 17 inches
diameter and 2 feet stroke; grate-surface 15<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> square feet,
and heating-surface 1,058 square feet. It weighs 63,100
pounds, of which 39,000 pounds are on the drivers and
24,100 on the truck. The freight-engine has six driving-wheels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
54<span class="enum">5</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span> inches in diameter. The steam-cylinders are
18 inches in diameter, stroke 22 inches, grate-surface 14.8
square feet, heating-surface 1,096 feet. It weighs 68,500
pounds, of which 48,000 are on the drivers and 20,500 on
the truck. The former takes a train of five cars up an
average grade of 90 feet to the mile. The latter is attached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
to a train of 11 cars. On a grade of 50 feet to the mile,
the former takes 7 and the latter 17 cars. Tank-engines
for very heavy work, such as on grades of 320 feet to the
mile, which are found on some of the mountain lines of
road, are made with five pairs of driving-wheels, and with
no truck. The steam-cylinders are 20<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span> inches in diameter,
2 feet stroke; grate-area, 15<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> feet; heating-surface, 1,380
feet; weight with tank full, and full supply of wood,
112,000 pounds; average weight, 108,000 pounds. Such
an engine has hauled 110 tons up this grade at the speed
of 5 miles an hour, the steam-pressure being 145 pounds.
The adhesion was about 23 per cent. of the weight.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig129" id="Fig129"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129.</span>&mdash;The American Type of Express-Engine, 1878.</p></div>

<p>In checking a train in motion, the inertia of the engine
itself absorbs a seriously large portion of the work of the
brakes. This is sometimes reduced by reversing the engine
and allowing the steam-pressure to act in aid of the brakes.
To avoid injury by abrasion of the surfaces of piston, cylinder,
and the valves and valve-seats, M. Le Chatelier introduces
a jet of steam into the exhaust-passages when
reversing, and thus prevents the ingress of dust-laden air
and the drying of the rubbing surfaces. This method of
checking a train is rarely resorted to, however, except in
case of danger. The introduction of the &#8220;continuous&#8221; or
&#8220;air&#8221; brake, which can be thrown into action in an instant
on every car of the train by the engine-driver, is so efficient
that it is now almost universally adopted. It is one of the
most important safeguards which American ingenuity has
yet devised. In drawing a train weighing 150 tons at the
rate of 60 miles an hour, about 800 effective horse-power is
required. A speed of 80 miles an hour has been often
attained, and 100 miles has probably been reached.</p>

<p>The American locomotive-engine has a maximum life
which may be stated at about 30 years. The annual cost
of repairs is from 10 to 15 per cent. of its first cost. On
moderately level roads, the engine requires a pint of oil to
each 25 miles, and a ton of coal to each 40 or 50 miles run.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>

<p>Although the above sketch and description represent
the construction and performance of the standard locomotive
of the present time, there are indications that the compound
arrangement of engines will ultimately be adopted.
This will involve a considerable change of proportions,
greatly increasing the volume and weight of steam-cylinders,
but enabling the designer to more than proportionally
decrease the weight of boiler and the quantity of
fuel carried. There is no serious objection to their use,
however, and no insuperable difficulty in the construction
of the &#8220;double-cylinder&#8221; type of engine for the locomotive.
A few such engines have already been put in service.
In these engines the high-pressure cylinder is placed
on one side and the larger low-pressure cylinder on the other
side of the locomotive, thus having but two cylinders, as in
the older plan. The valve-gear is the Stephenson link, as
in the ordinary engine. At starting, the steam is allowed
to act on both pistons; but after a few revolutions the
course of the steam is changed, and the exhaust from the
smaller cylinder, instead of passing into the chimney, is
sent to the larger cylinder, which is at the same time
cut off from the main steam-pipe. When the engine is
ascending a steep gradient the steam may, if necessary, be
taken from the boiler into both cylinders, as when starting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Compound engines of this kind have been used on the
French line of railroad from Bayonne to Biarritz. They
were designed by Mallet and built at Le Creuzot. The
steam-cylinders are of 9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> and
15<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> inches diameter, and of
17<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> inches stroke of piston. The four driving-wheels are
4 feet in diameter, and the total weight of engine is 20
tons. The boiler has 484<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> square feet of heating-surface,
and is built to carry 10 atmospheres pressure. When hauling
trains of 50 tons at 25 miles an hour, these engines require
about 15 pounds of good coal per mile.</p>

<p>The total length of the railways in operation in the
United States on the 1st day of January, 1877, was 76,640
miles,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
being an average of one mile of railway for every
600 inhabitants. The railways are as follows:</p>

<p>In 1873 came the great financial crisis, with its terrible
results of interrupted production, poverty, and starvation,
and an almost total cessation of the work of building new
railroads. The largest number of miles ever built in any
one year were constructed in 1872. The greatest mileage
is in Illinois, reaching 6,589; the smallest in Rhode
Island, 136, and in Washington Territory, 110. The
State of Massachusetts has one mile of railroad to 4.86<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
miles of territory, this ratio being the greatest in the country.
The longest road in operation is the Chicago &amp; Northwestern,
extending 1,500 miles; the shortest, the Little
Saw-Mill Run Road in Pennsylvania, which is but three
miles in length. The total capital of railways in the country
is $6,000,000,000, or an average of $100,000 per mile.
The earnings for the year 1872 amounted to $454,969,000,
or $7,500 per mile. The largest net earnings recorded as
made on any road were gained by the New York Central
&amp; Hudson River, $8,260,827; the smallest on several
roads which not only earned nothing, but incurred a loss.</p>

<p>The catastrophe of 1873-&#8217;74 revealed the fact that the
latter condition of railroad finances was vastly more common
than had been suspected; and it is still doubtful
whether the existing immense network of railroads which
covers the United States can be made, as a whole, to pay
even a moderate return on the money invested in their construction.
At the period of maximum rate of extension of
railroads in the United States&mdash;1873&mdash;the reported lengths
of the railroads of Europe and America were as follows:<a name="FNanchor_94_94"

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>The railroads in Great Britain comprise over 15,000 miles
of track now being worked in the United Kingdom, on which
have been expended $2,800,000,000. This sum is equal to five
times the amount of the annual value of all the real property
in Great Britain, and two-thirds of the national debt.
After deducting all the working expenses, the gross net
annual revenue of all the roads exceeds by $110,000,000 the
total revenue from all sources of Belgium, Holland, Portugal,
Denmark, Sweden and Norway. An army of 100,000
officers and servants is in the employ of the companies,
and the value of the rolling-stock exceeds $150,000,000.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Marine Engines.</span></h4>

<p>The changes which have now become completed in the
marine steam-engine have been effected at a later date than
those which produced the modern locomotive. On the
American rivers the modification of the beam-engine since
the time of Robert L. Stevens has been very slight. The
same general arrangement is retained, and the details are
little, if at all, altered. The pressure of steam is sometimes
as high as 60 pounds per square inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig130" id="Fig130"></a>
<img src="images/illo407.png" alt="BeamEngine" width="350" height="457" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.</span>&mdash;Beam-Engine.</p></div>

<p>The valves are of the disk or poppet variety, rising and
falling vertically. They are four in number, two steam
and two exhaust valves being placed at each end of the
steam-cylinder. The beam-engine is a peculiarly American
type, seldom if ever seen abroad. <a href="#Fig130">Fig. 130</a> is an outline
sketch of this engine as built for a steamer plying on the
Hudson River. This class of engine is usually adopted in
vessels of great length, light draught, and high speed.
But one steam-cylinder is commonly used. The cross-head
is coupled to one end of the beam by means of a pair of
links, and the motion of the opposite end of the beam is
transmitted to the crank by a connecting-rod of moderate
length. The beam has a cast-iron centre surrounded by a
wrought-iron strap of lozenge shape, in which are forged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the bosses for the end-centres, or for the pins to which the
connecting-rod and the links are attached. The main centre
of the beam is supported by a &#8220;gallows-frame&#8221; of timbers
so arranged as to receive all stresses longitudinally.
The crank and shaft are of wrought-iron. The valve-gear
is usually of the form already mentioned as the Stevens
valve-gear, the invention of Robert L. and Francis B. Stevens.
The condenser is placed immediately beneath the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
steam-cylinder. The air-pump is placed close beside it, and
worked by a rod attached to the beam. Steam-vessels on
the Hudson River have been driven by such engines at the
rate of 20 miles an hour. This form of engine is remarkable
for its smoothness of operation, its economy and durability,
its compactness, and the latitude which it permits in
the change of shape of the long, flexible vessels in which it
is generally used, without injury by &#8220;getting out of line.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig131" id="Fig131"></a>
<img src="images/illo408.png" alt="Oscillating Engine and Feathering Paddle Wheel" width="382" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131.</span>&mdash;Oscillating Engine and Feathering Paddle-Wheel.</p></div>

<p>For paddle-engines of large vessels, the favorite type,
which has been the side-lever engine, is now rarely built. For
smaller vessels, the oscillating engine with feathering paddle-wheels
is still largely employed in Europe. This style
of engine is shown in <a href="#Fig131">Fig. 131</a>. It is very compact, light,
and moderately economical, and excels in simplicity. The
usual arrangement is such that the feathering-wheel has the
same action upon the water as a radial wheel of double
diameter. This reduction of the diameter of the wheel,
while retaining maximum effectiveness, permits a high
speed of engine, and therefore less weight, volume, and
cost. The smaller wheel-boxes, by offering less resistance
to the wind, retard the progress of the vessel less than those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of radial wheels. Inclined engines are sometimes used for
driving paddle-wheels. In these the steam-cylinder lies in
an inclined position, and its connecting-rod directly connects
the crank with the cross-head. The condenser and
air-pump usually lie beneath the cross-head guides, and are
worked by a bell-crank driven by links on each side the
connecting-rod, attached to the cross-head. Such engines
are used to some extent in Europe, and they have been
adopted in the United States navy for side-wheel gunboats.
They are also used on the ferry-boats plying between New
York and Brooklyn.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig132" id="Fig132"></a>
<img src="images/illo410.png" alt="The Two Rhode Islands" width="500" height="242" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 132.</span>&mdash;The Two Rhode Islands, 1836-1876.</p></div>

<p>Among the finest illustrations of recent practice in the
construction of side-wheel steamers are those built for the
several routes between New York and the cities of New
England which traverse Long Island Sound. Our <a href="#Fig132">illustration</a>
exhibits the form of these vessels, and also shows well
the modifications in structure and size which have been
made during this generation. The later vessel is 325 feet
long, 45 feet beam, 80 feet wide over the &#8220;guards,&#8221; and 16
feet deep, drawing 10 feet of water. The &#8220;frames&#8221; upon
which the planking of the hull is fastened are of white-oak,
and the lighter and &#8220;top&#8221; timbers of cedar and locust.
The engine has a steam-cylinder 90 inches in diameter and
12 feet stroke of piston.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> On each side the great saloons
which extend from end to end of the upper deck are state-rooms,
containing each two berths and elegantly furnished.
The engine of this vessel is capable of developing about
2,500 horse-power. The great wheels, of which the paddle-boxes
are seen rising nearly to the height of the hurricane-deck,
are 37<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter and 12 in breadth. The hull
of this vessel, including all wood-work, weighs over 1,200
tons. The weight of the machinery is about 625 tons.
The steamer makes 16 knots an hour when the engine is at
its best speed&mdash;about 17 revolutions per minute&mdash;and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
average speed is about 14 knots on its route of 160 miles.
The coal required to supply the furnaces of such a vessel
and with such machinery would be about 3 tons per hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
or a little over 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> pounds per horse-power. The construction
of such a vessel occupies, usually, about a year, and
costs a quarter of a million dollars.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig133" id="Fig133"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 133.</span>&mdash;A Mississippi Steamboat.</p></div>

<p>The non-condensing direct-acting engine is used principally
on the Western rivers, driven by steam of from 100
to 150 pounds pressure, and exhausts its steam into the atmosphere.
It is the simplest possible form of direct-acting
engine. The valves are usually of the &#8220;poppet&#8221; variety,
and are operated by cams which act at the ends of long
levers having their fulcra on the opposite side of the valve,
the stem of which latter is attached at an intermediate
point. The engine is horizontal, and the connecting-rod
directly attached to cross-head and crank-pin without intermediate
mechanism. The paddle-wheel is used, sometimes
as a stern-wheel, as in the plan of Jonathan Hulls of one and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
a half century ago, sometimes as a side-wheel, as is most
usual elsewhere. One of the most noted of these steamers,
plying on the Mississippi, is shown in the preceding <a href="#Fig133">sketch</a>.</p>

<p>One of the largest of these steamers was the Grand
Republic,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
a vessel 340 feet long, 56 feet beam, and 10<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> feet
depth. The draught of water of this great craft was 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
feet forward and 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> aft. The two sets of compound engines,
28 and 56 inches diameter and of 10 feet stroke, drive
wheels 38<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter and 18 feet wide. The boilers
were steel. A steamer built still later on the Ohio has the
following dimensions: Length, 225 feet; breadth, 35<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet;
depth, 5 feet; cylinders, 17<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">8</span> inches in diameter, 6 feet
stroke; three boilers. The hull and cabin were built at
Jeffersonville, Ind. She has 40 large state-rooms. The
cost of the steamer was $40,000.</p>

<p>These vessels have now opened to commerce the whole
extent of the great Mississippi basin, transporting a large
share of the products of a section of country measuring a
million and a half square miles&mdash;an area equal to many
times that of New York State, and twelve times that of
the island of Great Britain&mdash;an area exceeding that of the
whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia and Turkey, and capable,
if as thoroughly cultivated as the Netherlands, of supporting
a population of between three and four hundred
millions of people.</p>

<p>The steam-engine and propelling apparatus of the modern
ocean-steamer have now become almost exclusively the
compound or double-cylinder engine, driving the screw.
The form and the location of the machinery in the vessel
vary with the size and character of the ship which it drives.
Very small boats are fitted with machinery of quite a different
kind from that built for large steamers, and war-vessels
have usually been supplied with engines of a design
radically different from that adopted for merchant-steamers.</p>

<p>The introduction of <i><a href="#Fig134">Steam-Launches</a></i> and small pleasure-boats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
driven by steam-power is of comparatively recent
date, but their use is rapidly increasing. Those first built
were heavy, slow, and complicated; but, profiting by experience,
light and graceful boats are now built, of remarkable
swiftness, and having such improved and simplified
machinery that they require little fuel and can be easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
managed. Such boats have strong, carefully-modeled hulls,
light and strong boilers, capable of making a large amount
of dry steam with little fuel, and a light, quick-running engine,
working without shake or jar, and using steam economically.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig135" id="Fig135"></a>
<img src="images/illo414.png" alt="Launch-Engine" width="292" height="550" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 135.</span>&mdash;Launch-Engine.</p></div>

<p>The above <a href="#Fig135">sketch</a> represents the engine built by a New
York firm for such little craft. This is the smallest size
made for the market. It has a steam-cylinder 3 inches in
diameter and a stroke of piston of 5 inches, driving a screw
26 inches in diameter and of 3 feet pitch. The maximum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
power of the engine is four or five times the nominal power.
The boiler is of the form shown in the illustrations of semi-portable
engines, and has a heating-surface, in this case,
of 75 square feet. The boat itself is like that seen on page
386, and is 25 feet long, of 5 feet 8 inches beam, and draws
2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> feet of water. These little machines weigh about 150
pounds per nominal horse-power, and the boilers about 300.</p>

<p>Some of these little vessels have attained wonderful
speed. A British steam-yacht, the Miranda, 45<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in
length, 5<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> feet wide, and drawing 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet of water, with a
total weight of 3<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>
tons, has steamed nearly 18<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles an
hour for short runs. The boat was driven by an engine of
6 inches diameter of cylinder and 8 inches stroke of piston,
making 600 revolutions per minute, driving a two-bladed
screw 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet in diameter and of
3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">3</span> feet pitch. Its machinery
had a total weight of two tons. Another English
yacht, the Firefly, is said to have made 18.94 miles an hour.
A little French yacht, the Hirondelle, has attained a speed
of 16 knots, equal to about 18<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles, an hour. This was,
however, a much larger vessel than the preceding. One of
the most remarkable of these little steamers is a torpedo-boat
built for the United States navy. This vessel is 60
feet long, 6 feet wide, and 5 feet deep; its screw is 38
inches in diameter and of 5 feet pitch, two-bladed, and is
driven, by a very light engine and boiler, 400 revolutions
per minute, the boat attaining a speed of 19 to 20 miles an
hour. Another little vessel, the Vision, made nearly as
great speed, developing 20 horse-power with engine and
boiler weighing but about 400 pounds.</p>

<p>Yachts of high speed require such weight and bulk of
engine that but little space is left for cabins, and they are
usually exceedingly uncomfortable vessels. In the Miranda
the weight of machinery is more than one-half the total
weight of the whole. An illustration of the more comfortable
and more generally liked pleasure-yacht is the Day
Dream. The length is 105 feet, and the boat draws 5<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
feet of water. There are two engines, having steam-cylinders
14 inches in diameter and of the same length of stroke,
direct-acting, condensing, and driving a screw, of 7 feet
diameter and of 10<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet pitch, 135 revolutions a minute,
giving the yacht a speed of 13<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> knots an hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig136" id="Fig136"></a>
<img src="images/illo416.png" alt="Horizontal Direct-Acting Naval Screw-Engine" width="550" height="319" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 136.</span>&mdash;Horizontal, Direct-acting Naval Screw-Engine.</p></div>

<p>In larger vessels, as in yachts, in nearly all cases, the
ordinary screw-engine is direct-acting. Two engines are
placed side by side, with cranks on the shaft at an angle
of 90&deg; with each other. In merchant-steamers the
steam-cylinders are usually vertical and directly over the
crank-pins, to which the cross-heads are coupled. The condenser
is placed behind the engine-frame, or, where a jet-condenser
is used, the frame itself is sometimes made hollow,
and serves as a condenser. The air-pump is worked by
a beam connected by links with the cross-head. The general
arrangement is like that shown in <a href="#Fig137">Figs. 137</a> and <a href="#Fig138">138</a>.
For naval purposes such a form is objectionable, since its
height is so great that it would be exposed to injury by
shot. In naval engineering the cylinder is placed horizontally,
as in <a href="#Fig136">Fig. 136</a>, which is a sectional view, representing
an horizontal, direct-acting naval screw-engine, with jet-condenser
and double-acting air and circulating pumps. <i>A</i>
is the steam-cylinder, <i>B</i> the piston, which is connected to
the crank-pin by the piston-rod, <i>D</i>, and connecting-rod, <i>E</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
<i>F</i> is the cross-head guide. The eccentrics, <i>G</i>, operate the
valve, which is of the &#8220;three-ported variety,&#8221; by a Stephenson
link. Reversing is effected by the hand-wheel, <i>C</i>,
which, by means of a gear, <i>m</i>, and a rack, <i>k</i>, elevates and
depresses the link, and thus reverses the valve.</p>

<p>The trunk-engine, in which the connecting-rod is attached
directly to the piston and vibrates within a trunk or
cylinder secured to the piston, moving with it, and extending
outside the cylinder, like an immense hollow piston-rod,
is frequently used in the British navy. It has rarely
been adopted in the United States.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>In nearly all steam-vessels which have been built for
the merchant service recently, and in some naval vessels,
the compound engine has been adopted. <a href="#Fig137">Figs. 137</a> and <a href="#Fig138">138</a>
represent the usual form of this engine. Here <i>A A</i>, <i>B B</i>
are the small and the large, or the high-pressure and the
low-pressure cylinders respectively. <i>C C</i> are the valve-chests.
<i>G G</i> is the condenser, which is invariably a surface-condenser.
The condensing water is sometimes directed
around the tubes contained within the casing, <i>G G</i>,
while the steam is exhausted around them and among them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
and sometimes the steam is condensed within the tubes,
while the injection-water which is sent into the condenser
to produce condensation passes around the exterior of the
tubes. In either case, the tubes are usually of small diameter,
varying from five-eighths to half an inch, and in length
from four to seven feet. The extent of heating-surface is
usually from one-half to three-fourths that of the heating-surface
of the boilers.</p>

<p>The air and circulating pumps are placed on the lower
part of the condenser-casting, and are operated by a crank
on the main shaft at <i>N</i>; or they are sometimes placed as
in the style of engine last described, and driven by a beam
worked by the cross-head. The piston-rods, <i>T S</i>, are guided
by the cross-heads, <i>V V</i>, working in slipper-guides, and to
these cross-heads are attached the connecting-rods, <i>X X</i>,
driving the cranks, <i>M M</i>. The cranks are now usually set
at right angles; in some engines this angle is increased to
120&deg;, or even 180&deg;. Where it is arranged as here shown,
an intermediate reservoir, <i>P O</i>, is placed between the two
cylinders to prevent the excessive variations of pressure
that would otherwise accompany the varying relative motions
of the pistons, as the steam passes from the high-pressure
to the low-pressure cylinder. Steam from the
boilers enters the high-pressure steam-chest, <i>x</i>, and is admitted
by the steam-valve alternately above and below the
piston as usual. The exhaust steam is conducted through
the exhaust passage around into the reservoir, <i>P</i>, whence it
it is taken by the low-pressure cylinder, precisely as the
smaller cylinder drew its steam from the boiler. From the
large or low-pressure cylinder the steam is exhausted into
the condenser. The valve-gear is usually a Stephenson
link, <i>g e</i>, the position of which is determined, and the reversal
of which is accomplished, by a hand-wheel, <i>o</i>, and
screw, <i>m n p</i>, which, by the bell-crank, <i>k i</i>, are attached to
the link, <i>g e</i>. The &#8220;box-framing&#8221; forms also the hot-well.
The surface-condenser is cleared by a single-acting air-pump,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
inside the frame, at <i>T</i>. The feed-pump and the bilge-pumps
are driven from the cross-head of the air-pump.</p>

<p>The successful introduction of the double-cylinder engine
was finally accomplished by the exertions of a few
engineers, who were at once intelligent enough to understand
its advantages, and energetic and enterprising enough
to push it forward in spite of active opposition, and powerful
enough, pecuniarily and in influence, to succeed.
The most active and earnest of these eminent men was
<a href="#Port12">John Elder</a>, of the firm of Randolph, Elder &amp; Co., subsequently
John Elder &amp; Co., of Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Elder was of Scotch descent. His ancestors had, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
generations, shown great skill and talent in construction,
and had always been known as successful millwrights. John
Elder was born at Glasgow, March 8, 1824, and died in
London, September 17, 1869. He was educated at the
Glasgow High-School and in the College of Engineering at
the University of Glasgow, where, however, his attendance
was but for a short time. He learned the trade under his
father in the workshops of the Messrs. Napier, and became
an unusually expert draughtsman. After spending three
years in charge of the drawing-office at the engine-building
works of Robert Napier, where his father had been manager,
Elder became a partner in the firm which had previously
been known as Randolph, Elliott &amp; Co., in the year 1852.
The firm commenced building iron vessels in 1860.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the experiments of Hornblower and
Wolff, of Allaire and Smith, and of McNaught, Craddock,
and Nicholson, together with the theoretical investigations
of Thompson, Rankine, Clausius, and others, had shown
plainly in what direction to look for improvement upon
then standard engines, and what direction practice was
taking with all types. The practical deductions which were
becoming evident were recognized very early by Elder, and
he promptly began to put in practice the principles which
his knowledge of thermo-dynamics and of mechanics enabled
him to appreciate. He adopted the compound engine,
and coupled his cranks at angles of 180&deg;, in order to avoid
losses due to the friction of the crank-shaft in its bearings,
by effecting a partial counterbalancing of pressures on the
journals. Elder was one of the first to point out the fact that
the compound engine had proved itself more efficient than
the single-cylinder engine, only when the pressure of steam
carried and the extent to which expansion was adopted exceeded
the customary practice of his time. His own practice
was, from the first, successful, and from 1853 to 1867 he
and his partners were continually engaged in the construction
of steamers and fitting them with compound engines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>The engines of their first vessel, the Brandon, required
but 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pounds of coal per hour and per horse-power, in
1854, when the usual consumption was a third more. Five
years later, they had built engines which consumed a third
less than those of the Brandon; and thenceforward, for
many years, their engines, when of large size, exhibited
what was then thought remarkable economy, running on a
consumption of from 2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> to
2<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> pounds.</p>

<p>In the year 1865 the British Government ordered a
competitive trial of three naval vessels, which only differed
in the form of their engines. The Arethusa was
fitted with trunk-engines of the ordinary kind; the Octavia
had three steam-cylinders, coupled to three cranks placed
at angles of 120&deg; with each other; and the Constance was
fitted with compound engines, two sets of three cylinders
each, and each taking steam from the boiler into one cylinder,
passing it through the other two with continuous expansion,
and finally exhausting from the third into the condenser.
These vessels, during one week&#8217;s steaming at sea,
averaged, respectively, 3.64, 3.17, and 2.51 pounds of coal
per hour and per horse-power, and the Constance showed a
marked superiority in the efficiency of the mechanism of
her engines, when the losses by friction were compared.</p>

<p>The change from the side-lever single-cylinder engine,
with jet-condenser and paddle-wheels, to the direct-acting
compound engine, with surface-condenser and screw-propellers,
has occurred within the memory and under the observation
of even young engineers, and it may be considered
that the revolution has not been completely effected. This
change in the design of engine is not as great as it at first
seemed likely to become. Builders have but slowly learned
the principles stated above in reference to expansion in one
or more cylinders, and the earlier engines were made with
a high and low pressure cylinder working on the same connecting-rod,
and each machine consisted of four steam-cylinders.
It was at last discovered that a high-pressure single-cylinder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
engine exhausting into a separate larger low-pressure
engine might give good results, and the compound
engine became as simple as the type of engine which it
displaced. This independence of high and low pressure engines
is not in itself novel, for the plan of using the exhaust
of a high-pressure engine to drive a low-pressure condensing
engine was one of the earliest of known combinations.</p>

<p>The advantage of introducing double engines at sea is
considerably greater than on land. The coal carried by a
steam-vessel is not only an item of great importance in consequence
of its first cost, but, displacing its weight or bulk
of freight which might otherwise be carried, it represents so
much non-paying cargo, and is to be charged with the full
cost of transportation in addition to first cost. The best of
steam-coal is therefore usually chosen for steamers making
long voyages, and the necessity of obtaining the most economical
engines is at once seen, and is fully appreciated by
steamship proprietors. Again, an economy of one-fourth of
a pound per horse-power per hour gives, on a large transatlantic
steamer, a saving of about 100 tons of coal for a
single voyage. To this saving of cost is to be added the
gain in wages and sustenance of the labor required to handle
that coal, and the gain by 100 tons of freight carried in
place of the coal.</p>

<p>For many years the change which has here been outlined,
in the forms of engine and the working of steam expansively,
was retarded by the inefficiency of methods and
tools used in construction. With gradual improvement in
tools and in methods of doing work, it became possible to
control higher steam and to work it successfully; and the
change in this direction has been steadily going on up to
the present time with all types of steam-engine. At sea
this rise of pressure was for a considerable time retarded
by the serious difficulty encountered in the tendency of the
sulphate of lime to deposit in the boiler. When steam-pressure
had risen to 25 pounds per square inch, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
found that no amount of &#8220;blowing out&#8221; would prevent the
deposition of seriously large quantities of this salt, while at
the lower pressures at first carried at sea no troublesome
precipitation occurred, and the only precaution necessary
was to blow out sufficient brine to prevent the precipitation
of common salt from a supersaturated solution. The
introduction of surface-condensation was promptly attempted
as the remedy for this evil, but for many years
it was extremely doubtful whether its disadvantages were
not greater than its advantages. It was found very difficult
to keep the condensers tight, and boilers were injured
by some singular process of corrosion, evidently due to the
presence of the surface-condenser. The simple expedient
of permitting a very thin scale to form in the boiler was,
after a time, hit upon as a means of overcoming this difficulty,
and thenceforward the greatest obstacle to the general
introduction was the conservative disposition found
among those who had charge of marine machinery, which
conservatism regarded with suspicion every innovation.
Another trouble arose from the difficulty of finding men
neither too indolent nor too ignorant to take charge of the
new condenser, which, more complicated and more readily
disarranged than the old, demanded a higher class of attendants.
Once introduced, however, the surface-condenser
removed the obstacle to further elevation of steam-pressure,
and the rise from 20 to 60 pounds pressure soon occurred.
Elder and his competitors on the Clyde were the first to
take advantage of the fact when these higher pressures became
practicable.</p>

<p>The lightness of engine and the smaller weight of boiler
secured when the simpler type of &#8220;compound&#8221; engine is
used are great advantages, and, when coupled with the
fact that by no other satisfactory device can great expansion
and consequent economy of fuel be obtained at sea,
the advantages are such as to make the adoption of this
style of engine imperative for ship-propulsion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>This extreme lightness in machinery has been largely,
also, the result of very careful and skillful designing, of
intelligent construction, and of care in the selection and
use of material. British builders had, until after the introduction
of these later types of vessels-of-war, been distinguished
rather by the weight of their machinery than for
nice calculation and proportioning of parts. Now the engines
of the heavy iron-clads are models of good proportions,
excellence in materials, and of workmanship, which
are well worthy of study. The weight per indicated horse-power
has been reduced from 400 or 500 pounds to less
than half that amount within the last ten years. This has
been accomplished by forcing the boilers&mdash;although thus,
to some extent, losing economy&mdash;by higher steam-pressure,
a very much higher piston-speed, reduction of friction of
parts, reduction of capacity for coal-stowage, and exceedingly
careful proportioning. The reduction of coal-bunker
capacity is largely compensated by the increase of economy
secured by superheating, by increased expansion, elevation
of piston-speed, and the introduction of surface-condensation.</p>

<p>A good marine steam-engine of the form which was
considered standard 15 or 20 years ago, having low-pressure
boilers carrying steam at 20 or 25 pounds pressure as
a maximum, expanding twice or three times, and having a
jet-condenser, would require about 30 or 35 pounds of feed-water
per horse-power per hour; substituting surface-condensation
for that produced by the jet brought down the
weight of steam used to from 25 to 30 pounds; increasing
steam-pressure to 60 pounds, expanding from five to eight
times, and combining the special advantages of the superheater
and the compound engine with surface-condensation,
has reduced the consumption of steam to 20, or even, in
some cases, 15 pounds of steam per horse-power per hour.
Messrs. Perkins, of London, guarantee, as has already
been stated, to furnish engines capable of giving a horse-power
with a consumption of but 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> pound of coal. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
C. E. Emery reports the United States revenue-steamer
Hassler, designed by him, to have given an ordinary sea-going
performance which is probably fully equal to anything
yet accomplished. The Hassler is a small steamer, of
but 151 feet in length, 24<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet beam, and 10 feet draught.
The engines have steam-cylinders 18.1 and 28 inches diameter,
respectively, and of 28 inches stroke of piston, indicating
125 horse-power; with steam at 75 pounds pressure,
and at a speed of but 7 knots, the coal consumed was but
1.87 pound per horse-power per hour.</p>

<p>The committee of the British Admiralty on designs of
ships-of-war have reported recently: &#8220;The carrying-power
of ships may certainly be to some extent increased by the
adoption of compound engines in her Majesty&#8217;s service.
Its use has recently become very general in the mercantile
marine, and the weight of evidence in favor of the large
economy of fuel thereby gained is, to our minds, overwhelming
and conclusive. We therefore beg earnestly to
recommend that the use of compound engines may be generally
adopted in ships-of-war hereafter to be constructed,
and applied, whenever it can be done with due regard to
economy and to the convenience of the service, to those
already built.&#8221;</p>

<p>The forms of screws now employed are exceedingly
diverse, but those in common use are not numerous. In
naval vessels it is common to apply screws of two blades,
that they may be hoisted above water into a &#8220;well&#8221; when
the vessel is under sail, or set with the two blades directly
behind the stern-post, when their resistance to the forward
motion of the vessel will be comparatively small. In other
vessels, and in the greater number of full-power naval vessels,
screws of three or four blades are used.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig139" id="Fig139">
</a><img src="images/illo427.png" alt="Screw-Propeller" width="500" height="499" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;Screw-Propeller.</p></div>

<p>The usual form of screw (<a href="#Fig139">Fig. 139</a>) has blades of nearly
equal breadth from the hub to the periphery, or slightly
widening toward their extremities, as is seen in an exaggerated
degree in <a href="#Fig140">Fig. 140</a>, representing the form adopted
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
tug-boats, where large surface near the extremity is more
generally used than in vessels of high speed running free.
In the Griffith screw, which has been much used, the hub
is globular and very large. The blades are secured to the
hub by flanges, and are bolted on in such a manner that
their position may be changed slightly if desired. The
blades are shaped like the section of a pear, the wider part
being nearest the hub, and the blades tapering rapidly
toward their extremities. A usual form is intermediate
between the last, and is like that shown in <a href="#Fig141">Fig. 141</a>, the
hub being sufficiently enlarged to permit the blades to be
attached as in the Griffith screw, but more nearly cylindrical,
and the blades having nearly uniform width from end
to end.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>The pitch of a screw is the distance which would be
traversed by the screw in one revolution were it to move
through the water without slip; i. e., it is double the distance
<i>C D</i>, <a href="#Fig140">Fig. 140</a>. <i>C D&#8242;</i> represents the helical path of
the extremity of the blade <i>B</i>, and <i>O E F H K</i> is that of
the blade <i>A</i>. The proportion of diameter to the pitch of
the screw is determined by the speed of the vessel. For
low speed the pitch may be as small as 1<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> the diameter.
For vessels of high speed the pitch is frequently double the
diameter. The diameter of the screw is made as great as
possible, since the slip decreases with the increase of the
area of screw-disk. Its length is usually about one-sixth of
the diameter. A greater length produces loss by increase
of surface causing too great friction, while a shorter screw
does not fully utilize the resisting power of the cylinder of
water within which it works, and increased slip causes
waste of power. An empirical value for the probable slip
in vessels of good shape, which is closely approximate usually,
is <i>S</i> = 4<i>M</i>&#8725;<i>A</i>,
in which <i>S</i> is the slip per cent., and <i>M</i> and
<i>A</i> are the areas of the midship section and of the screw-disk
in square feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig141" id="Fig141"></a>
<img src="images/illo428b.png" alt="Hirsch Screw" width="350" height="333" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 141.</span>&mdash;Hirsch Screw.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>The most effective screws have slightly greater pitch at
the periphery than at the hub, and an increasing pitch from
the forward to the rear part of the screw. The latter
method of increasing pitch is more generally adopted alone.
The thrust of the screw is the pressure which it exerts in
driving the vessel forward. In well-formed vessels, with
good screws, about two-thirds of the power applied to the
screw is utilized in propulsion, the remainder being wasted
in slip and other useless work. Its efficiency is in such a
case, therefore, 66 per cent. Twin screws, one on each side
of the stern-post, are sometimes used in vessels of light
draught and considerable breadth, whereby decreased slip
is secured.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, the introduction of the compound
engine has been attempted, but with less success
than in Europe, by several American engineers.</p>

<p>The most radical change in the methods of ship-propulsion
which has been successfully introduced in some localities
has been the adoption of a system of &#8220;wire-rope towage.&#8221;
It is only well adapted for cases in which the steamer
traverses the same line constantly, moving backward and
forward between certain points, and is never compelled to
deviate to any considerable extent from the path selected.
A similar system is in use in Canada, but it has not yet
come into use in the United States, notwithstanding the
fact that, wherever its adoption is practicable, it has a
marked superiority in economy over the usual methods of
propulsion. With chain or rope traction there is no loss by
slip or oblique action, as in both screw and paddle-wheel
propulsion. In the latter methods these losses amount to
an important fraction of the total power; they rarely, if
ever, fall below a total of 25 per cent., and probably in
towage exceed 50 per cent. The objection to the adoption
of chain-propulsion, as it is also often called, is the necessity
of following closely the line along which the chain or the
rope is laid. There is, however, much less difficulty than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
would be anticipated in following a sinuous route or in
avoiding obstacles in the channel or passing other vessels.
The system is particularly well adapted for use on canals.</p>

<p>The steam-boilers in use in the later and best marine
engineering practice are of various forms, but the standard
types are few in number. That used on river-steamers in
the United States has already been described.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig142" id="Fig142"></a>
<img src="images/illo430.png" alt="Marine Fire-Tubular Boiler, Section" width="350" height="313" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 142.</span>&mdash;Marine Fire-tubular Boiler. Section.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig142">Fig. 142</a> is a type of marine tubular boiler which is in
most extensive use in sea-going steamers for moderate
pressure, and particularly for naval vessels. Here the gases
pass directly into the back connection from the fire, and
thence forward again, through horizontal tubes, to the front
connection and up the chimney. In naval vessels the steam-chimney
is omitted, as it is there necessary to keep all parts
of the boiler as far below the water-line as possible. Steam
is taken from the boiler by pipes which are carried from
end to end of the steam-space, near the top of the boiler,
the steam entering these pipes through small holes drilled
on the other side. Steam is thus taken from the boiler
&#8220;wet,&#8221; but no large quantity of water can usually be &#8220;entrained&#8221;
by the steam.</p>

<p>A marine boiler has been quite extensively introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
into the United States navy, in which the gases are led
from the back connection through a tube-box around and
among a set of upright water-tubes, which are filled with
water, circulation taking place freely from the water-space
immediately above the crown-sheet of the furnace up
through these tubes into the water-space above them.
These &#8220;water-tubular&#8221; boilers have a slight advantage
over the &#8220;fire-tubular&#8221; boilers already described in compactness,
in steaming capacity, and in economical efficiency.
They have a very marked advantage in the facility with
which the tubes may be scraped or freed from the deposit
when a scale of sulphate of lime or other salt has formed
within them by precipitation from the water. The fire-tubular
boiler excels in convenience of access for plugging
up leaking tubes, and is much less costly than the water-tubular.
The water-tube class of boilers still remain in
extensive use in the United States naval steamers. They
have never been much used in the merchant service, although
introduced by James Montgomery in the United
States and by Lord Dundonald in Great Britain twenty
years earlier. Opinion still remains divided among engineers
in regard to their relative value. They are gradually
reassuming prominence by their introduction in the modified
form of sectional boilers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig143" id="Fig143"></a>
<img src="images/illo431.png" alt="Marine High-Pressure Boiler, Section" width="350" height="254" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 143.</span>&mdash;Marine High-Pressure Boiler. Section.</p></div>

<p>Marine boilers are now usually given the form shown in
section in <a href="#Fig143">Fig. 143</a>. This form of
boiler is adopted where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
steam-pressures of 60 pounds and upward are carried, as in
steam-vessels supplied with compound engines, cylindrical
forms being considered the best with high pressures. The
large cylindrical flues, therefore, form the furnaces as
shown in the transverse sectional view. The gases rise, as
shown in the longitudinal section, through the connection,
and pass back to the end of the boiler through the tubes,
and thence, instead of entering a steam-chimney, they are
conducted by a smoke-connection, not shown in the sketch,
to the smoke funnel or stack. In merchant-steamers, a
steam-drum is often mounted horizontally above the boiler.
In other cases a separator is attached to the steam-pipe
between boilers and engines. This usually consists of an
iron tank, divided by a vertical partition extending from the
top nearly to the bottom. The steam, entering the top at
one side of this partition, passes underneath it, and up to
the top on the opposite side, where it issues into a steam-pipe
leading directly to the engine. The sudden reversal
of its course at the bottom causes it to leave the suspended
water in the bottom of the separator, whence it is drained
off by pipes.</p>

<p>The most interesting illustrations of recent practice in
marine engineering and naval architecture are found in the
steamers which are now seen on transoceanic routes for the
merchant service, and, in the naval service, in the enormous
iron-clads which have been built in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The City of Peking is one of the finest examples of
American practice. This vessel was constructed for the
Pacific Mail Company. The hull is 423 feet long, of 48
feet beam, and 38<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet deep. Accommodations are furnished
for 150 cabin and 1,800 steerage passengers, and the
coal-bunkers &#8220;stow&#8221; 1,500 tons of coal. The iron plates
of which the sides and bottom are made are from <span class="enum">11</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">16</span> to one
inch in thickness. The weight of iron used in construction
was about 5,500,000 pounds. The machinery weighed nearly
2,000,000 pounds, with spare gear and accessory apparatus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
The engines are compound, with two steam-cylinders of
51 inches and two of 88 inches diameter, and a stroke of
piston of 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet. The condensing water is sent through
the surface-condensers by circulating-pumps driven by their
own engines. Ten boilers furnish steam to these engines,
each having a diameter of 13 feet, a length of 13<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet, and
a thickness of &#8220;shell&#8221; of 1<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">16</span> inch. Each has three furnaces,
and contains 204 tubes of an outside diameter of 3<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> inches.
All together, they have 520 square feet of grate-surface and
17,000 square feet of heating-surface. The area of cooling-surface
in the condensers is 10,000 square feet. The City
of Rome, a ship of later design, is 590 feet long, &#8220;over all,&#8221;
52 feet beam, 52 feet deep, and measures 8,300 tons. The
engines, of 8,500 horse-power, will drive the vessel 18 knots
(21 miles) an hour; they have six steam-cylinders (three
high and three low pressure), and are supplied with steam
by 8 boilers heated by 48 furnaces. The hull is of steel, the
bottom double, and the whole divided into ten compartments
by transverse bulkheads. Two longitudinal bulkheads
in the engine and boiler compartments add greatly to the
safety of the vessel.</p>

<p>The most successful steam-vessels in general use are these
screw-steamers of transoceanic lines. Those of the transatlantic
lines are now built from 350 to 550 feet long, generally
propelled from 12 to 18 knots (14 to 21 miles) an hour,
by engines of from 3,000 to 8,000 horse-power, consuming
from 70 to 250 tons of coal a day, and crossing the Atlantic
in from eight to ten days. These vessels are now invariably
fitted with the compound engine and surface-condensers.
One of these vessels, the Germanic, has been reported at
Sandy Hook, the entrance to New York Harbor, in 7 days 11
hours 37 minutes from Queenstown&mdash;a distance, as measured
by the log and by observation, of 2,830 miles. Another
steamer, the Britannic, has crossed the Atlantic in 7 days 10
hours and 53 minutes. These vessels are of 5,000 tons burden,
of 750 &#8220;nominal&#8221; horse-power (probably 5,000 actual).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407-408]</a></span>The <a href="#Fig144">modern steamship</a>
is as wonderful an illustration of
ingenuity and skill in all interior arrangements as in size,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a></span>
power, and speed. The size of sea-going steamers has become
so great that it is unsafe to intrust the raising of the anchor
or the steering of the vessel to manual power and skill; and
these operations, as well as the loading and unloading of the
vessel, are now the work of the same great motor&mdash;steam.</p>

<p>The now common form of auxiliary engine for controlling
the helm is one of the inventions of the American engineer
F. E. Sickels, who devised the &#8220;Sickels cut-off,&#8221; and
was first invented about 1850. It was exhibited at London
at the International Exhibition of 1851. It consists<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a
href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> principally
of two cylinders working at right angles upon a shaft
geared into a large wheel fastened by a friction-plate lined
with wood, and set by a screw to any desired pressure on
the steering-apparatus. The wheel turned by the steersman
is connected with the valve-gear of the cylinders, so
that the steam, or other motor, will move the rudder precisely
as the helmsman moves the wheel adjusting the
steam-valves. This wheel thus becomes the steering-wheel.
The apparatus is usually so arranged that it may be connected
or disconnected in an instant, and hand-steering
adopted if the smoothness of the sea and the low speed of
the vessel make it desirable or convenient. This method
was first adopted in the United States on the steamship
Augusta.</p>

<p>The same inventor and others have contrived &#8220;steam-windlasses,&#8221;
some of which are in general use on large vessels.
The machinery of these vessels is also often fitted
with a steam &#8220;reversing-gear,&#8221; by means of which the engines
are as easily man&oelig;uvred as are those of the smallest
vessels, to which hand-gear is always fitted. In one of these
little auxiliary engines, as devised by the author, a small
handle being adjusted to a marked position, as to the point
marked &#8220;stop&#8221; on an index-plate, the auxiliary engine at
once starts, throws the valve-gear into the proper position&mdash;as,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
if a link-motion, into &#8220;middle-gear&#8221;&mdash;thus stopping the
large engines, and then it itself stops. Setting the handle
so that its pointer shall point to &#8220;ahead,&#8221; the little engine
starts again, sets the link in position to go ahead, thus
starting the large engines, and again stops itself. If set at
&#8220;back,&#8221; the same series of operations occurs, leaving the
main engines backing and the little &#8220;reversing engine&#8221;
stopped. A number of forms of reversing engine are in
use, each adapted to some one type of engine.</p>

<p>The hull of the transatlantic steamer is now always of
iron, and is divided into a number of &#8220;compartments,&#8221; each
of which is water-tight and separated from the adjacent
compartments by iron &#8220;bulkheads,&#8221; in which are fitted
doors which, when closed, are also water-tight. In some
cases these doors close automatically when the water rises
in the vessel, thus confining it to the leaking portion.</p>

<p>Thus we have already seen a change in transoceanic
lines from steamers like the Great Western (1837), 212 feet
in length, of 35<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet beam, and 23 feet depth, driven by
engines of 450 horse-power, and requiring 15 days to cross
the Atlantic, to steamships over 550 feet long, 55 feet beam,
and 55 feet deep, with engines of 10,000 horse-power, crossing
the Atlantic in 7 days; iron substituted for wood in
construction, the cost of fuel reduced one-half, and the
speed raised from 8 to 18 knots and over. In the earlier
days of steamships they were given a proportion of length
to breadth of from 5 to 6 to 1; in forty years the proportion
increased until 11 to 1 was reached.</p>

<p>The whole naval establishment of every country has
been greatly modified by the recent changes in methods of
attack and defense; but the several classes of ships which
still form the naval marine are all as dependent upon their
steam-machinery as ever.</p>

<p>It is only recently that the attempt seems to have been
made to determine a classification of war-vessels and to
plan a naval establishment which shall be likely to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
fully the requirements of the immediate future. It has
hitherto been customary simply to make each ship a little
stronger, faster, or more powerful to resist or to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
attack than was the last. The fact that the direction of
progress in naval science and architecture is plainly perceivable,
and that upon its study may be based a fair estimate
of the character and relative distribution of several classes
of vessels, seems to have been appreciated by very few.</p>

<p>In the year 1870 the writer proposed<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a
href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> a classification of
vessels other than torpedo-vessels, which has since been also
proposed in a somewhat modified form by Mr. J. Scott
Russell.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The author then remarked that the increase so
rapidly occurring in weight of ordnance and of armor, and
in speed of war-vessels, would probably soon compel a division
of the vessels of every navy into three classes of
ships, exclusive of torpedo-vessels, one for general service
in time of peace, the others for use only in time of war.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first class may consist of unarmored vessels of
moderate size, fair speed under steam, armed with a few
tolerably heavy guns, and carrying full sail-power.</p>

<p>&#8220;The second class may be vessels of great speed under
steam, unarmored, carrying light batteries and as great
spread of canvas as can readily be given them; very much
such vessels as the Wampanoag class of our own navy were
intended to be&mdash;calculated expressly to destroy the commerce
of an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The third class may consist of ships carrying the
heaviest possible armor and armament, with strongly-built
bows, the most powerful machinery that can be given them,
of large coal-carrying capacity, and unencumbered by sails,
everything being made secondary to the one object of obtaining
victory in contending with the most powerful of
possible opponents. Such vessels could never go to sea
singly, but would cruise in couples or in squadrons. It
seems hardly doubtful that attempts to combine the qualities
of all classes in a single vessel, as has hitherto been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
done, will be necessarily given up, although the classification
indicated will certainly tend largely to restrict naval
operations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The introduction of the stationary, the floating, and the
automatic classes of torpedoes, and of torpedo-vessels, has
now become accomplished, and this element, which it was
predicted by Bushnell and by Fulton three-quarters of a
century ago would at some future time become important
in warfare, is now well recognized by all nations. How far
it may modify future naval establishments cannot be yet
confidently stated, but it seems sufficiently evident that the
attack, by any navy, of stationary defenses protected by
torpedoes is now quite a thing of the past. It may be perhaps
looked upon as exceedingly probable that torpedo-ships
of very high speed will yet drive all heavily-armored
vessels from the ocean, thus completing the historic parallel
between the man-in-armor of the middle ages and the armored
man-of-war of our own time.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Of these classes, the third is of most interest, as exhibiting
most perfectly the importance and variety of the work
which the steam-engine is made to perform. On the later
of these vessels, the anchor is raised by a steam anchor-hoisting
apparatus; the heavier spars and sails are handled
by the aid of a steam-windlass; the helm is controlled by a
steering-engine, and the helmsman, with his little finger,
sets in motion a steam-engine, which adjusts the rudder
with a power which is unimpeded by wind or sea, and with
an exactness that could not be exceeded by the hand-steering
gear of a yacht; the guns are loaded by steam, are elevated
or depressed, and are given lateral training, by the
same power; the turrets in which the guns are incased are
turned, and the guns are whirled toward every point of the
compass, in less time than is required to sponge and reload<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
them; and the ship itself is driven through the water by
the power of ten thousand horses, at a speed which is only
excelled on land by that of the railroad-train.</p>

<p>The British Minotaur was one of the earlier iron-clads.
The great length and consequent difficulty of man&oelig;uvring,
the defect of speed, and the weakness of armor of these
vessels have led to the substitution of far more effective
designs in later constructions. The Minotaur is a four-masted
screw iron-clad, 400 feet long, of 59 feet beam and
26<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet draught of water.
Her speed at sea is about 12<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
knots, and her engines develop, as a maximum, nearly 6,000
indicated horse-power. Her heaviest armor-plates are but
6 inches in thickness. Her extreme length and her unbalanced
rudder make it difficult to turn rapidly. With <i>eighteen
men at the steering-wheel</i> and sixty others on the tackle,
the ship, on one occasion, was 7<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> minutes in turning completely
around. These long iron-clads were succeeded by
the shorter vessels designed by Mr. E. J. Reed, of which
the first, the Bellerophon, was of 4,246 tons burden, 300
feet long by 56 feet beam, and 24<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet draught, of the 14-knot
speed, with 4,600 horse-power; and having the &#8220;balanced
rudder&#8221; used many years earlier in the United States
by Robert L. Stevens,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a
href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> it can turn in four minutes with
eight men at the wheel. The cost of construction was some
$600,000 less than that of the Minotaur. A still later vessel,
the Monarch, was constructed on a system quite similar
to that known in the United States as the Monitor type, or
as a turreted iron-clad. This vessel is 330 feet long, 57<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>
feet wide, and 36 feet deep, drawing 24<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet of water.
The total weight of ship and contents is over 8,000 tons,
and the engines are of over 8,500 horse-power. The armor
is 6 and 7 inches thick on the hull, and 8 inches on the two
turrets, over a heavy teak backing. The turrets contain
each two 12-inch rifled guns, weighing 25 tons each, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
with a charge of 70 pounds of powder, throwing a shot of
600 pounds weight with a velocity of 1,200 feet per second,
and giving it a <i>vis viva</i> equivalent to the raising of
over 6,100 tons one foot high, and equal to the work of penetrating
an iron plate 13<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> inches thick. This immense vessel
is driven by a pair of &#8220;single-cylinder&#8221; engines having
steam-cylinders <i>ten feet</i> in diameter and of 4<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet stroke
of piston, driving a two-bladed Griffith screw of 23<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet
diameter and 26<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> feet pitch, 65 revolutions, at the maximum
speed of 14.9 knots, or about 17<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> miles, an hour.
To drive these powerful engines, boilers having an aggregate
of about 25,000 square feet (or more than a half-acre)
of heating-surface are required, with 900 square feet
of grate-surface. The refrigerating surface in the condensers
has an area of 16,500 square feet&mdash;over one-third of an
acre. The cost of these engines and boilers was &pound;66,500.</p>

<p>Were all this vast steam-power developed, giving the
vessel a speed of 15 knots, the ship, if used as a &#8220;ram,&#8221;
would strike an enemy at rest with the tremendous &#8220;energy&#8221;
of 48,000 foot-tons&mdash;equal to the shock of the projectiles
of eight or nine such guns as are carried by the iron-clad
itself, simultaneously discharged upon one spot.</p>

<p>But even this great vessel is less formidable than later
vessels. One of the latter, the Inflexible, is a shorter but
wider and deeper ship than the Monarch, measuring 320
feet long, 75 feet beam, and 25 draught, displacing over
10,000 tons. The great rifles carried by this vessel weigh
81 tons each, throwing shot weighing a half-ton from behind
iron-plating two feet in thickness. The steam-engines
are of about the same power as those of the Monarch,
and give this enormous hull a speed of 14 knots an hour.</p>

<p>The navy of the United States does not to-day possess
iron-clads of power even approximating that of either of
several classes of British and other foreign naval vessels.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span>&mdash;The Great Eastern.</p></div>

<p>The largest vessel of any class yet constructed is the
Great Eastern (<a href="#Fig146">Fig. 146</a>), begun in 1854 and completed
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
1859, by J. Scott Russell, on the Thames, England. This ship
is 680 feet long, 83 feet wide, 58 feet deep, 28 feet draught,
and of 24,000 tons measurement. There are four paddle and
four screw engines, the former having steam-cylinders 74
inches in diameter, with 14 feet stroke, the latter 84 inches in
diameter and 4 feet stroke. They are collectively of 10,000
actual horse-power. The paddle-wheels are 56 feet in diameter,
the screw 24 feet. The steam-boilers supplying the
paddle-engines have 44,000 square feet (more than an acre)
of heating-surface. The boilers supplying the screw-engines
are still larger. At 30 feet draught, this great vessel
displaces 27,000 tons. The engines were designed to develop
10,000 horse-power, driving the ship at the rate of
16<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> statute miles an hour.</p>

<p>The figures quoted in the descriptions of these great
steamships do not enable the non-professional reader to form
a conception of the wonderful power which is concentrated
within so small a space as is occupied by their steam-machinery.
The &#8220;horse-power&#8221; of the engines is that determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
by James Watt as the maximum obtainable for eight
hours a day from the strongest London draught-horses.
The ordinary average draught-horse would hardly be able
to exert two-thirds as much during the eight hours&#8217; steady
work of a working-day. The working-day of the steam-engine,
on the other hand, is twenty-four hours in length.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig147" id="Fig147"></a>
<img src="images/illo443.png" alt="The Great Eastern At Sea" width="400" height="316" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 147.</span>&mdash;The Great Eastern at Sea.</p></div>

<p>The work of the 10,000 horse-power engines of the
Great Eastern could be barely equaled by the efforts of
15,000 horses; but to continue their work uninterruptedly,
day in and day out, for weeks together, as when done by
steam, would require at least three relays, or 45,000 horses.
Such a stud would weigh 25,000 tons, and if harnessed
&#8220;tandem&#8221; would extend thirty miles. It is only by such a
comparison that the mind can begin to comprehend the
utter impossibility of accomplishing by means of animal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
power the work now done for the world by steam. The
cost of the greater power is but about one-tenth that of
horse-power, and by its means tasks are accomplished with
ease which are absolutely impossible of accomplishment by
animal power.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the total steam-power of the world
is about 15,000,000 horse-power, and that, were horses actually
employed to do the work which these engines would
be capable of doing were they kept constantly in operation,
the number required would exceed 60,000,000.</p>

<p>Thus, from the small beginnings of the Comte d&#8217;Auxiron
and the Marquis de Jouffroy in France, of Symmington
in Great Britain, and of Henry, Rumsey, and Fitch, and of
Fulton and Stevens, in the United States, steam-navigation
has grown into a great and inestimable aid and blessing to
mankind.</p>

<p>We to-day cross the ocean with less risk, and transport
ourselves and our goods at as little cost in either time
or money as, at the beginning of the century, our parents
experienced in traveling one-tenth the distance.</p>

<p>It is largely in consequence of this ingenious application
of a power that reminds one of the fabled genii of Eastern
romance, that the mechanic and the laborer of to-day enjoy
comforts and luxuries that were denied to wealth, and to
royalty itself, a century ago.</p>

<p>The magnitude of our modern steamships excites the
wonder and admiration of even the people of our own time;
and there is certainly no creation of art that can be grander
in appearance than a transatlantic steamer a hundred and
fifty yards in length, and weighing, with her stores, five or
six thousand tons, as she starts on her voyage, moved by
engines equal in power to the united strength of thousands
of horses; none can more fully awaken a feeling of awe
than an immense structure like the great modern iron-clads
(<a href="#Fig145">Fig. 145</a>), vessels having a total weight of 8,000 to 10,000
tons, and propelled by steam-engines of as many horse-power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
carrying guns whose shot penetrate solid iron 20
inches thick, and having a power of impact, when steaming
at moderate speed, sufficient to raise 35,000 tons a foot high.</p>

<p>Far more huge than the Monarch among the iron-clads
even is that prematurely-built monster, the Great Eastern
(<a href="#Fig147">Fig. 147</a>), already described, an eighth of a mile long, and
with steam doing the work of a stud of 45,000 horses.</p>

<p><a name="Darwin" id="Darwin"></a>Thus we are to-day witnessing the literal fulfillment of
the predictions of Oliver Evans and of John Stevens, and
almost that contained in the couplets written by the poet
Darwin, who, more than a century ago, before even the
earliest of Watt&#8217;s improvements had become generally
known, sang:</p>

arisen from that extension, we feel convinced that every invention which

progress of the steam-engine during those forty years does not to-day appear

truth, nevertheless.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Of all the features which characterize this progressive economical
movement of civilized nations, that which first excites attention, through
its intimate connection with the phenomena of production, is the perpetual
and, so far as human foresight can extend, the unlimited growth of man&#8217;s
power over Nature. Our knowledge of the properties and laws of physical
objects shows no sign of approaching its ultimate boundaries; it is advancing
more rapidly, and in a greater number of directions at once, than in any
previous age or generation, and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored
fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with
Nature is still almost in its infancy.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mill.</span></p></div>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>The growth of the philosophy of the steam-engine presents
as interesting a study as that of the successive changes
which have occurred in its mechanism.</p>

<p>In the operation of the steam-engine we find illustrated
many of the most important principles and facts which constitute
the physical sciences. The steam-engine is an exceedingly
ingenious, but, unfortunately, still very imperfect,
machine for transforming the heat-energy obtained by the
chemical combination of a combustible with the supporter
of combustion into mechanical energy. But the original
source of all this energy is found far back of its first appearance
in the steam-boiler. It had its origin at the beginning,
when all Nature came into existence. After the solar
system had been formed from the nebulous chaos of creation,
the glowing mass which is now called the sun was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
depository of a vast store of heat-energy, which was thence
radiated into space and showered upon the attendant worlds
in inconceivable quantity and with unmeasured intensity.
During the past life of the globe, the heat-energy received
from the sun upon the earth&#8217;s surface was partly expended
in the production of great forests, and the storage, in the
trunks, branches, and leaves of the trees of which they were
composed, of an immense quantity of carbon, which had
previously existed in the atmosphere, combined with oxygen,
as carbonic acid. The great geological changes which
buried these forests under superincumbent strata of rock
and earth resulted in the formation of coal-beds, and the
storage, during many succeeding ages, of a vast amount of
carbon, of which the affinity for oxygen remained unsatisfied
until finally uncovered by the hand of man. Thus we
owe to the heat and light of the sun, as was pointed out by
George Stephenson, the incalculable store of potential energy
upon which the human race is so dependent for life
and all its necessaries, comforts, and luxuries.</p>

<p>This coal, thrown upon the grate in the steam-boiler,
takes fire, and, uniting again with the oxygen, sets free
heat in precisely the same quantity that it was received
from the sun and appropriated during the growth of the
tree. The actual energy thus rendered available is transferred,
by conduction and radiation, to the water in the
steam-boiler, converts it into steam, and its mechanical
effect is seen in the expansion of the liquid into vapor
against the superincumbent pressure. Transferred from
the boiler to the engine, the steam is there permitted to
expand, doing work, and the heat-energy with which it is
charged becomes partly converted into mechanical energy,
and is applied to useful work in the mill or to driving the
locomotive or the steamboat.</p>

<p>Thus we may trace the store of energy received from
the sun and contained in our coal through its several changes
until it is finally set at work; and we might go still further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
and observe how, in each case, it is again usually re-transformed
and again set free as heat-energy.</p>

<p>The transformation which takes place in the furnace is
a chemical change; the transfer of heat to the water and
the subsequent phenomena accompanying its passage
through the engine are physical changes, some of which
require for their investigation abstruse mathematical operations.
A thorough comprehension of the principles governing
the operation of the steam-engine, therefore, can only
be attained after studying the phenomena of physical
science with sufficient minuteness and accuracy to be able
to express with precision the laws of which those sciences
are constituted. The study of the philosophy of the steam-engine
involves the study of chemistry and physics, and of
the new science of energetics, of which the now well-grown
science of thermo-dynamics is a branch. This sketch of the
growth of the steam-engine may, therefore, be very properly
concluded by an outline of the growth of the several
sciences which together make up its philosophy, and
especially of the science of thermo-dynamics, which is peculiarly
the science of the steam-engine and of the other
heat-engines.</p>

<p>These sciences, like the steam-engine itself, have an origin
which antedates the commencement of the Christian
era; but they grew with an almost imperceptible growth
for many centuries, and finally, only a century ago, started
onward suddenly and rapidly, and their progress has never
since been checked. They are now fully-developed and
well-established systems of natural philosophy. Yet, like
that of the steam-engine and of its companion heat-engines,
their growth has by no means ceased; and, while the student
of science cannot do more than indicate the direction
of their progress, he can readily believe that the beginning
of the end is not yet reached in their movement toward
completeness, either in the determination of facts or in the
codification of their laws.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>When Hero lived at Alexandria, the great &#8220;Museum&#8221;
was a most important centre, about which gathered the
teachers of all then known philosophies and of all the then
recognized but unformed sciences, as well as of all those
technical branches of study which had already been so far
developed as to be capable of being systematically taught.
Astronomical observations had been made regularly and
uninterruptedly by the Chaldean astrologers for two thousand
years, and records extending back many centuries had
been secured at Babylon by Calisthenes and given to Aristotle,
the father of our modern scientific method. Ptolemy
had found ready to his hand the records of Chaldean observers
of eclipses extending back nearly 650 years, and
marvelously accurate.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>A rude method of printing with an engraved roller on
plastic clay, afterward baked, thus making up ceramic libraries,
was practised long previous to this time; and in
the alcoves in which Hero worked were many of these
books of clay.</p>

<p>This great Library and Museum of Alexandria was
founded three centuries before the birth of Christ, by Ptolemy
Soter, who established as his capital that great Egyptian
city when the death of his brother, the youthful but
famous conqueror whose name he gave it, placed him upon
the throne of the colossal successor of the then fallen
Persian Empire. The city itself, embellished with every
ornament and provided with every luxury that the wealth
of a conquered world or the skill, taste, and ingenuity of
the Greek painters, sculptors, architects, and engineers
could provide, was full of wonders; it was a wonder in itself.
This rich, populous, and magnificent city was the
metropolis of the then civilized world. Trade, commerce,
manufactures, and the fine arts were all represented in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
splendid exchange, and learning found its most acceptable
home and noblest field within the walls of Ptolemy&#8217;s Museum;
its disciples found themselves welcomed and protected
by its founder and his successors, Philadelphus and
the later Ptolemies.</p>

<p>The Alexandrian Museum was founded with the declared
object of collecting all written works of authority,
of promoting the study of literature and art, and of stimulating
and assisting experimental and mathematical scientific
investigation and research. The founders of modern
libraries, colleges, and technical schools have their prototype
in intelligence, public spirit, and liberality, in the first
of the Ptolemies, who not only spent an immense sum in
establishing this great institution, but spared no expense
in sustaining it. Agents were sent out into all parts of
the world, purchasing books. A large staff of scribes was
maintained at the museum, whose duty it was to multiply
copies of valuable works, and to copy for the library
such works as could not be purchased.</p>

<p>The faculty of the museum was as carefully organized
as was the plan of its administration. The four principal
faculties of astronomy, literature, mathematics, and medicine
were subdivided into sections devoted to the several
branches of each department. The collections of the museum
were as complete as the teachers of the undeveloped
sciences of the time could make them. Lectures were given
in all branches of study, and the number of students was
sometimes as great as twelve or thirteen thousand. The
number of books which were collected here, when the barbarian
leaders of the Roman troops under C&aelig;sar burned
the greater part of it, was stated to be 700,000. Of these,
400,000 were within the museum itself, and were all destroyed;
the rest were in the temple of Serapis, and, for
the time, escaped destruction.</p>

<p>The greatest of all the great men who lived at Alexandria
at the time of the establishment of the museum was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander and the friend of Ptolemy.
It is to Aristotle that we owe the systematization of
the philosophical ideas of Plato and the creation of the
inductive method, in which has originated all modern science.
It is to the learned men of Alexandria that we are
indebted for so effective an application of the Aristotelian
philosophy that all the then known sciences were given
form, and were so thoroughly established that the work of
modern science has been purely one of development.</p>

<p>The inductive method, which built up all the older
sciences, and which has created all those of recent development,
consists, first, in the discovery and quantitative
determination of facts; secondly, when a sufficient number
of facts have been thus observed and defined, in the grouping
of those facts, and the detection, by a study of their
mutual relations, of the natural laws which give rise to or
regulate them. This simple method is that&mdash;and the only&mdash;method
by which science advances. By this method, and
by it only, do we acquire connected and systematic knowledge
of all the phenomena of Nature of which the physical
sciences are cognizant. It is only by the application of this
Aristotelian method and philosophy that we can hope to
acquire exact scientific knowledge of existing phenomena,
or to become able to anticipate the phenomena which are
to distinguish the future. The Aristotelian method of observing
facts, and of inductive reasoning with those facts
as a basis, has taught the chemist the properties of the
known elementary substances and their characteristic behavior
under ascertained conditions, and has taught him
the laws of combination and the effects of their union, enabling
him to predict the changes and the phenomena,
chemical and physical, which inevitably follow their contact
under any specified set of conditions.</p>

<p>It is this process which has enabled the physicist to ascertain
the methods of molecular motion which give us
light, heat, or electricity, and the range of action and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
laws which govern the transfer of energy from one of these
modes of motion to another. It was this method of study
which enabled James Watt to detect and to remedy the
defects of the Newcomen engine, and it is by the Aristotelian
philosophy that the engineer of to-day is taught to construct
the modern steamship, and to predict, before the keel
is laid or a blow struck in the workshop or the ship-yard,
what will be the weight of the vessel, its cargo-carrying
capacity, the necessary size and power of its engines, the
quantity of coal which they will require per day while
crossing the ocean, the depth at which the great hull will
float in the water, and the exact speed that the vessel will
attain when the engines are exerting their thousand or their
ten thousand horse-power.</p>

<p>It was at Alexandria that this mighty philosophy was
first given a field in which to work effectively. Here Ptolemy
studied astronomy and &#8220;natural philosophy;&#8221; Archimedes
applied himself to the studies which attract the
mathematician and engineer; Euclid taught his royal pupil
those elements of geometry which have remained standard
twenty-two centuries; Eratosthenes and Hipparchus studied
and taught astronomy, and inaugurated the existing system
of quantitative investigation, proving the spherical form of
the earth; and Ctesibius and Hero studied pneumatics and
experimented with the germs of the steam-engine and of
less important machines.</p>

<p>When, seven centuries later, the destruction of this
splendid institution was signalized by the death of that
brilliant scholar and heathen teacher of philosophy, Hypatia,
at the hands of the more heathenish fanatics who tore
her in pieces at the foot of the cross, and by the dispersion
of the library left by C&aelig;sar&#8217;s soldiers in the Serapeum, a true
philosophy had been created, and the inductive method was
destined to live and to overcome every obstacle in the path
of enlightenment and civilization. The fall of the Alexandrian
Museum, sad as was the event, could not destroy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
new philosophical method. Its fruits ripened slowly but
surely, and we are to-day gathering a plentiful harvest.</p>

<p>Science, literature, and the arts, all remained dormant
for several centuries after the catastrophe which deprived
them of the light in which they had flourished so many
centuries. The armies of the caliphs made complete the
shameful work of destruction begun by the armies of C&aelig;sar,
and the Alexandrian Library, partly destroyed by the
Romans, was completely dispersed by the Patriarchs and
their ignorant and fanatical followers; and finally all the
scattered remnants were burned by the Saracens. But
when the thirst for conquest had become satiated or appeased,
the followers of the caliphs turned their attention
to intellectual pursuits, and the ninth century of the Christian
era saw once more such a collection of philosophical
writings, collected at Bagdad, as could only be gathered by
the power and wealth of the later conquerors of the world.
Philosophy once again resumed its empire, and another race
commenced the study of the mathematics of India and of
Greece, the astronomy of Chaldea, and of all the sciences
which originated in Greece and in Egypt. By the conquest
of Spain by the Saracens, the new civilization was imported
into Western Europe and libraries were gathered together
under the Moorish rulers, one of which numbered more
than a half-million volumes. Wherever Saracen armies
had extended Mohammedan rule, schools and colleges, libraries
and collections of philosophical apparatus, were
scattered in strange profusion; and students, teachers, philosophers,
of all&mdash;the speculative as well as the Aristotelian&mdash;schools,
gathered together at these intellectual
ganglia, as enthusiastic in their work as were their Alexandrian
predecessors. The endowment of colleges, that
truest gauge of the intelligence of the wealthy classes of
any community, became as common&mdash;perhaps more so&mdash;as
at the present time, and provision was made for the education
of rich and poor alike. The mathematical sciences,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
and the wonderful and beautiful phenomena which&mdash;but a
thousand years later&mdash;were afterward grouped into a science
and called chemistry, were especially attractive to the Arabian
scholars, and technical applications of discovered facts
and laws assisted in a wonderfully rapid development of
arts and manufactures.</p>

<p>When, a thousand years after Christ, the centre of intellectual
activity and of material civilization had drifted
westward into Andalusia, the foundation of every modern
physical science except that now just taking shape&mdash;the
all-grasping science of energetics&mdash;had been laid with experimentally
derived facts; and in mathematics there had
been erected a symmetrical and elegant superstructure.
Even that underlying principle of all the sciences, the principle
of the persistence of energy, had been, perhaps unwittingly,
enunciated.</p>

<p>Distinguished historians have shown how the progress
of civilization in Europe resulted in the creation, during
the middle ages, of the now great middle class, which, holding
the control of political power, governs every civilized
nation, and has come into power so gradually that it was
only after centuries that its influence was seen and felt.
This, which Buckle<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a
href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> calls the intellectual class, first became
active, independently of the military and of the clergy, in
the fourteenth century. In the two succeeding centuries
this class gained power and influence; and in the seventeenth
century we find a magnificent advance in all branches
of science, literature, and art, marking the complete emancipation
of the intellect from the artificial conditions which
had so long repressed its every effort at advancement.</p>

<p>Another great social revolution thus occurred, following
another period of centuries of intellectual stagnation.
The Saracen invaders were driven from Europe; the Crusaders
invaded Palestine, in the vain effort to recover from
the hands of the infidels the Holy Sepulchre and the Holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
Land; and intestine broils and inter-state conflicts, as well
as these greater social movements, withdrew the minds of
men once more from the arts of peace and the pursuits of
scholars. It is not, then, until the beginning of the seventeenth
century&mdash;the time of Galileo and of Newton&mdash;that we
find the nations of Europe sufficiently quiet and secure to
permit general attention to intellectual vocations, although it
was a half-century earlier (1543) that Copernicus left to the
world that legacy which revolutionized the theories of the
astronomers and established as correct the hypothesis which
made the sun the centre of the solar system.</p>

<p>Galileo now began to overturn the speculations of the
deductive philosophers, and to proclaim the still disputed
principle that the book of Nature is a trustworthy commentary
in the study of theological and revealed truths, so
far as they affect or are affected by science; he suffered
martyrdom when he proclaimed the fact that God&#8217;s laws,
as they now stand, had been instituted without deference
to the preconceived notions of the most ignorant of men.
Bruno had a few years earlier (1600) been burned at the
stake for a similar offense.</p>

<p>Galileo was perhaps the first, too, to combine invariably
in application the idea of Plato, the philosophy of Aristotle,
and the methods of modern experimentation, to form
the now universal scientific method of experimental philosophy.
He showed plainly how the grouping of ascertained
facts, in natural sequence, leads to the revelation of the law
of that sequence, and indicated the existence of a principle
which is now known as the law of continuity&mdash;the law that
in all the operations of Nature there is to be seen an unbroken
chain of effect leading from the present back into a
known or an unknown past, toward a cause which may or
may not be determinable by science or known to history.</p>

<p>Galileo, the Italian, was worthily matched by Newton,
the prince of English philosophers. The science of theoretical
mechanics was hardly beginning to assume the position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
which it was afterward given among the sciences; and
the grand work of collating facts already ascertained, and
of definitely stating principles which had previously been
vaguely recognized, was splendidly done by Newton. The
needs of physical astronomy urged this work upon him.</p>

<p>Da Vinci had, in the latter half of the fifteenth century,
summarized as much of the statics of mechanical philosophy
as had, up to his time, been given shape; he also rewrote
and added very much to what was known on the subject of
friction, and enunciated its laws. He had evidently a good
idea of the principle of &#8220;virtual velocities,&#8221; that simple
case of equivalence of work, in a connected system, which
has done such excellent service since; and with his mechanical
philosophy this versatile engineer and artist curiously
mingled much of physical science. Then Stevinus, the
&#8220;brave engineer of Bruges,&#8221; a hundred years later (1586),
alternating office and field work, somewhat after the manner
of the engineer of to-day, wrote a treatise on mechanics,
which showed the value of practical experience and judgment
in even scientific work. And thus the path had been
cleared for Newton.</p>

<p>Meantime, also, Kepler had hit upon the true relations
of the distances of the planets and their periodic times,
after spending half a generation in blindly groping for them,
thus furnishing those great landmarks of fact in the mechanics
of astronomy; and Galileo had enunciated the laws
of motion. Thus the foundation of the science of dynamics,
as distinguished from statics, was laid, and the beginning
was made of that later science of energetics, of which
the philosophy of the steam-engine is so largely constituted.</p>

<p>Hooke, Huyghens, and others, had already seen some of
the principal consequences of these laws; but it remained for
Newton to enunciate them with the precision of a true mathematician,
and to base upon them a system of dynamical laws,
which, complemented by his announcement of the existence
of the force of gravitation, and his statement of its laws,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
gave a firm basis for all that the astronomer has since done
in those quantitative determinations of size, weight, and distance,
and of the movements of the heavenly bodies, which
compel the wonder and admiration of mankind.</p>

<p>The Arabians and Greeks had noticed that the direction
taken by a body falling under the action of gravitation was
directly toward the centre of the earth, wherever its fall
might occur; Galileo had shown, by his experiments at
Pisa, that the velocity of fall, second after second, varied
as the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., and that the distances
varied as the squares of the total periods of time during
which the body was falling, and that it was, in British
feet, very nearly sixteen times the square of that time in
seconds. Kepler had proved that the movements of the
heavenly bodies were just such as would occur under the
action of central attractive forces and of centrifugal force.</p>

<p>Putting all these things together, Newton was led to
believe that there existed a &#8220;force of gravity,&#8221; due to the
attraction, by the great mass of the earth, of its own particles
and of neighboring bodies, like the moon, of which
force the influence extended as far, at least, as the latter.
He calculated the motion of the earth&#8217;s satellite, on the
assumption that his theory and the then accepted measurements
of the earth&#8217;s dimensions were correct, and obtained
a roughly approximate result. Later, in 1679, he revised
his calculations, using Picard&#8217;s more accurate determination
of the dimensions of the earth, and obtained a result
which precisely tallied with careful measurements, made by
the astronomers, of the moon&#8217;s motion.</p>

<p>The science of mechanics had now, with the publication
of Newton&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28233">Principia</a>,&#8221; become thoroughly consistent and
logically complete, so far as was possible without a knowledge
of the principles of energetics; and Newton&#8217;s enunciations
of the laws of motion, concise and absolutely perfect
as they still seem, were the basis of the whole science
of dynamics, as applied to bodies moving freely under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
action of applied forces, either constant or variable. They
are as perfect a basis for that science as are the primary
principles of geometry for the whole beautiful structure
which is built up on them.</p>

<p>The three perfect qualitative expressions of dynamical
law are:</p>

<p>1. Every free body continues in the state in which it
may be, whether of rest or of rectilinear uniform motion,
until compelled to deviate from that state by impressed
forces.</p>

<p>2. Change of motion is proportional to the force impressed,
and in the direction of the right line in which that
force acts.</p>

<p>3. Action is always opposed by reaction; action and
reaction are equal, and in directly contrary directions.</p>

<p>We may add to these principles a definition of a force,
which is equally and absolutely complete:</p>

<p><i>Force</i> is that which produces, or tends to produce, motion,
or change of motion, in bodies. It is measured statically
by the weight that will counterpoise it, or by the
pressure which it will produce, and dynamically by the velocity
which it will produce, acting in the unit of time on
the unit of mass.</p>

<p>The quantitative determinations of dynamic effects of
forces are always readily made when it is remembered that
the effect of a force equal to its own weight, when the body
is free to move, is to produce in one second a velocity of
32.2 feet per second, which quantity is the unit of dynamic
measurement.</p>

<p><i>Work</i> is the product of the resistance met in any instance
of the exertion of a force, into the distance through
which that force overcomes the resistance.</p>

<p><i>Energy</i> is the work which a body is capable of doing,
by its weight or inertia, under given conditions. The energy
of a falling body, or of a flying shot, is about <span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">64</span> its
weight multiplied by the square of its velocity, or, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
is the same thing, the product of its weight into the height
of fall or height due its velocity. These principles and
definitions, with the long-settled definitions of the primary
ideas of space and time, were all that were needed to lead
the way to that grandest of all physical generalizations,
the doctrine of the persistence or conservation of all energy,
and to its corollary declaring the equivalence of all forms
of energy, and also to the experimental demonstration of
the transformability of energy from one mode of existence
to another, and its universal existence in the various modes
of motion of bodies and of their molecules.</p>

<p>Experimental physical science had hardly become acknowledged
as the only and the proper method of acquiring
knowledge of natural phenomena at the time of Newton;
but it soon became a generally accepted principle. In
physics, Gilbert had made valuable investigations before
Newton, and Galileo&#8217;s experiments at Pisa had been examples
of similarly useful research. In chemistry, it was only
when, a century later, Lavoisier showed by his splendid example
what could be done by the skillful and intelligent
use of quantitative measurements, and made the balance
the chemist&#8217;s most important tool, that a science was formed
comprehending all the facts and laws of chemical change
and molecular combination. We have already seen how
astronomy and mathematics together led philosophers to
the creation and the study of what finally became the science
of mechanics, when experiment and observation were finally
brought to their aid. We can now see how, in all these
physical sciences, four primitive ideas are comprehended:
matter, force, motion, and space&mdash;which latter two terms
include all relations of position.</p>

<p>Based on these notions, the science of mechanics comprehends
four sections, which are of general application in
the study of all physical phenomena. These are:</p>

<p><i>Statics</i>, which treats of the action and effect of forces.</p>

<p><i>Kinematics</i>, which treats of relations of motion simply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dynamics</i>, or kinetics, which treats of simple motion as
an effect of the action of forces.</p>

<p><i>Energetics</i>, which treats of modifications of energy
under the action of forces, and of its transformation from
one mode of manifestation to another, and from one body
to another.</p>

<p>Under the latter of these four divisions of mechanical
philosophy is comprehended that latest of the minor sciences,
of which the heat-engines, and especially the steam-engine,
illustrate the most important applications&mdash;<i>Thermo-dynamics</i>.
This science is simply a wider generalization
of principles which, as we have seen, have been established
one at a time, and by philosophers widely separated both
geographically and historically, by both space and time,
and which have been slowly aggregated to form one after
another of the sciences, and out of which, as we now are
beginning to see, we are slowly evolving wider generalizations,
and thus tending toward a condition of scientific
knowledge which renders more and more probable the truth
of Cicero&#8217;s declaration: &#8220;One eternal and immutable law
embraces all things and all times.&#8221; At the basis of the
whole science of energetics lies a principle which was enunciated
before Science had a birthplace or a name:</p>

<p><i>All that exists, whether matter or force, and in whatever
form, is indestructible, except by the Infinite Power
which has created it.</i></p>

<p>That matter is indestructible by finite power became
admitted as soon as the chemists, led by their great teacher
Lavoisier, began to apply the balance, and were thus able
to show that in all chemical change there occurs only a
modification of form or of combination of elements, and
no loss of matter ever takes place. The &#8220;persistence&#8221; of
energy was a later discovery, consequent largely upon the
experimental determination of the convertibility of heat-energy
into other forms and into mechanical work, for
which we are indebted to Rumford and Davy, and to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
determination of the quantivalence anticipated by Newton,
shown and calculated approximately by Colding and Mayer,
and measured with great probable accuracy by Joule.</p>

<p>The great fact of the conservation of energy was loosely
stated by Newton, who asserted that the work of friction
and the <i>vis viva</i> of the system or body arrested by friction
were equivalent. In 1798, Benjamin Thompson, Count
Rumford, an American who was then in the Bavarian service,
presented a paper<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> to the Royal Society of Great
Britain, in which he stated the results of an experiment
which he had recently made, proving the immateriality of
heat and the transformation of mechanical into heat energy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
This paper is of very great historical interest, as the now
accepted doctrine of the persistence of energy is a generalization
which arose out of a series of investigations, the
most important of which are those which resulted in the
determination of the existence of a definite quantivalent
relation between these two forms of energy and a measurement
of its value, now known as the &#8220;mechanical equivalent
of heat.&#8221; His experiment consisted in the determination
of the quantity of heat produced by the boring of a
cannon at the arsenal at Munich.</p>

<p>Rumford, after showing that this heat could not have
been derived from any of the surrounding objects, or by
compression of the materials employed or acted upon, says:
&#8220;It appears to me extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
form any distinct idea of anything capable of being excited
and communicated in the manner that heat was excited and
communicated in these experiments, except it be motion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_106_106"
id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
He then goes on to urge a zealous and persistent investigation
of the laws which govern this motion. He estimates
the heat produced by a power which he states could easily
be exerted by one horse, and makes it equal to the &#8220;combustion
of nine wax candles, each three-quarters of an inch
in diameter,&#8221; and equivalent to the elevation of &#8220;25.68
pounds of ice-cold water&#8221; to the boiling-point, or 4,784.4
heat-units.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The time was stated at &#8220;150 minutes.&#8221; Taking
the actual power of Rumford&#8217;s Bavarian &#8220;one horse&#8221;
as the most probable figure, 25,000 pounds raised one foot
high per minute,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a
href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> this
gives the &#8220;mechanical equivalent&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
of the foot-pound as 783.8 heat-units, differing but 1.5 per
cent. from the now accepted value.</p>

<p>Had Rumford been able to eliminate all losses of heat
by evaporation, radiation, and conduction, to which losses
he refers, and to measure the power exerted with accuracy,
the approximation would have been still closer. Rumford
thus made the experimental discovery of the real nature
of heat, proving it to be a form of energy, and, publishing
the fact a half-century before the now standard determinations
were made, gave us a very close approximation to
the value of the heat-equivalent. Rumford also observed
that the heat generated was &#8220;exactly proportional to the
force with which the two surfaces are pressed together,
and to the rapidity of the friction,&#8221; which is a simple statement
of equivalence between the quantity of work done, or
energy expended, and the quantity of heat produced. This
was the first great step toward the formation of a Science
of Thermo-dynamics. Rumford&#8217;s work was the corner-stone
of the science.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy, a little later (1799), published the
details of an experiment which conclusively confirmed these
deductions from Rumford&#8217;s work. He rubbed two pieces
of ice together, and found that they were melted by the
friction so produced. He thereupon concluded: &#8220;It is evident
that ice by friction is converted into water.... Friction,
consequently, does not diminish the capacity of bodies
for heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bacon and Newton, and Hooke and Boyle, seem to
have anticipated&mdash;long before Rumford&#8217;s time&mdash;all later
philosophers, in admitting the probable correctness of that
modern dynamical, or vibratory, theory of heat which considers
it a mode of motion; but Davy, in 1812, for the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
time, stated plainly and precisely the real nature of heat,
saying: &#8220;The immediate cause of the phenomenon of heat,
then, is motion, and the laws of its communication are precisely
the same as the laws of the communication of motion.&#8221;
The basis of this opinion was the same that had
previously been noted by Rumford.</p>

<p>So much having been determined, it became at once evident
that the determination of the exact value of the mechanical
equivalent of heat was simply a matter of experiment;
and during the succeeding generation this determination
was made, with greater or less exactness, by several
distinguished men. It was also equally evident that the
laws governing the new science of thermo-dynamics could
be mathematically expressed.</p>

<p>Fourier had, before the date last given, applied mathematical
analysis in the solution of problems relating to the
transfer of heat without transformation, and his &#8220;Th&eacute;orie
de la Chaleur&#8221; contained an exceedingly beautiful treatment
of the subject. Sadi Carnot, twelve years later (1824),
published his &#8220;R&eacute;flexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu,&#8221;
in which he made a first attempt to express the principles
involved in the application of heat to the production of
mechanical effect. Starting with the axiom that a body
which, having passed through a series of conditions modifying
its temperature, is returned to &#8220;its primitive physical
state as to density, temperature, and molecular constitution,&#8221;
must contain the same quantity of heat which it had
contained originally, he shows that the efficiency of heat-engines
is to be determined by carrying the working fluid
through a complete cycle, beginning and ending with the
same set of conditions. Carnot had not then accepted the
vibratory theory of heat, and consequently was led into
some errors; but, as will be seen hereafter, the idea just
expressed is one of the most important details of a theory
of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>Seguin, who has already been mentioned as one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
first to use the fire-tubular boiler for locomotive engines,
published in 1839 a work, &#8220;Sur l&#8217;Influence des Chemins de
Fer,&#8221; in which he gave the requisite data for a rough determination
of the value of the mechanical equivalent of
heat, although he does not himself deduce that value.</p>

<p>Dr. Julius R. Mayer, three years later (1842), published
the results of a very ingenious and quite closely approximate
calculation of the heat-equivalent, basing his
estimate upon the work necessary to compress air, and on
the specific heats of the gas, the idea being that the work
of compression is the equivalent of the heat generated.
Seguin had taken the converse operation, taking the loss of
heat of expanding steam as the equivalent of the work done
by the steam while expanding. The latter also was the
first to point out the fact, afterward experimentally proved
by Hirn, that the fluid exhausted from an engine should
heat the water of condensation less than would the same
fluid when originally taken into the engine.</p>

<p>A Danish engineer, Colding, at about the same time
(1843), published the results of experiments made to determine
the same quantity; but the best and most extended
work, and that which is now almost universally accepted as
standard, was done by a British investigator.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Port14" id="Port14"></a>
<img src="images/illo466.png" alt="Joule" width="350" height="408" />
<p class="caption">James Prescott Joule.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Port14">James Prescott Joule</a> commenced the experimental investigations
which have made him famous at some time
previous to 1843, at which date he published, in the
<i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, his earliest method. His first determination
gave 770 foot-pounds. During the succeeding
five or six years Joule repeated his work, adopting a considerable
variety of methods, and obtaining very variable
results. One method was to determine the heat produced
by forcing air through tubes; another, and his usual plan,
was to turn a paddle-wheel by a definite power in a known
weight of water. He finally, in 1849, concluded these
researches.</p>

<p>The method of calculating the mechanical equivalent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
heat which was adopted by Dr. Mayer, of Heilbronn, is as
beautiful as it is ingenious: Conceive two equal portions of
atmospheric air to be inclosed, at the same temperature&mdash;as
at the freezing-point&mdash;in vessels each capable of containing
one cubic foot; communicate heat to both, retaining the
one portion at the original volume, and permitting the other
to expand under a constant pressure equal to that of the
atmosphere. In each vessel there will be inclosed 0.08073
pound, or 1.29 ounce, of air. When, at the same temperature,
the one has doubled its pressure and the other has
doubled its volume, each will be at a temperature of 525.2&deg;
Fahr., or 274&deg; C, and each will have double the original
temperature, as measured on the absolute scale from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
zero of heat-motion. But the one will have absorbed but
6<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span> British thermal units, while the other will have absorbed
9<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>. In the first case, all of this heat will have been employed
in simply increasing the temperature of the air; in
the second case, the temperature of the air will have been
equally increased, and, besides, a certain amount of work&mdash;2,116.3
foot-pounds&mdash;must have been done in overcoming
the resistance of the air; it is to this latter action that we
must debit the additional heat which has disappeared. Now,
(2,116.3/2<span class="enum">3</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">4</span>) = 770 foot-pounds per heat-unit&mdash;almost precisely
the value derived from Joule&#8217;s experiments. Had Mayer&#8217;s
measurement been absolutely accurate, the result of his
calculation would have been an exact determination of the
heat-equivalent, provided no heat is, in this case, lost by
internal work.</p>

<p>Joule&#8217;s most probably accurate measure was obtained
by the use of a paddle-wheel revolving in water or other
fluid. A copper vessel contained a carefully weighed portion
of the fluid, and at the bottom was a step, on which
stood a vertical spindle carrying the paddle-wheel. This
wheel was turned by cords passing over nicely-balanced
grooved wheels, the axles of which were carried on friction-rollers.
Weights hung at the ends of these cords were
the moving forces. Falling to the ground, they exerted an
easily and accurately determinable amount of work, <i>W</i> &times; <i>H</i>,
which turned the paddle-wheel a definite number of revolutions,
warming the water by the production of an amount
of heat exactly equivalent to the amount of work done.
After the weight had been raised and this operation repeated
a sufficient number of times, the quantity of heat
communicated to the water was carefully determined and
compared with the amount of work expended in its development.
Joule also used a pair of disks of iron rubbing
against each other in a vessel of mercury, and measured
the heat thus developed by friction, comparing it with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
work done. The average of forty experiments with water
gave the equivalent 772.692 foot-pounds; fifty with mercury
gave 774.083; twenty with cast-iron gave 774.987&mdash;the
temperature of the apparatus being from 55&deg; to 60&deg;
Fahr.</p>

<p>Joule also determined, by experiment, the fact that the
expansion of air or other gas without doing work produces
no change of temperature, which fact is predicable from
the now known principles of thermo-dynamics. He stated
the results of his researches relating to the mechanical
equivalent of heat as follows:</p>

<p>1. The heat produced by the friction of bodies, whether
solid or liquid, is always proportional to the quantity of
work expended.</p>

<p>2. The quantity required to increase the temperature of
a pound of water (weighed <i>in vacuo</i> at 55&deg; to 60&deg; Fahr.) by
one degree requires for its production the expenditure of a
force measured by the fall of 772 pounds from a height of
one foot. This quantity is now generally called &#8220;Joule&#8217;s
equivalent.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this series of experiments, Joule also deduced
the position of the &#8220;absolute zero,&#8221; the point at which heat-motion
ceases, and stated it to be about 480&deg; Fahr. below
the freezing-point of water, which is not very far from the
probably true value,-493.2&deg; Fahr. (-273&deg; C.), as deduced
afterward from more precise data.</p>

<p>The result of these, and of the later experiments of
Hirn and others, has been the admission of the following
principle:</p>

<p>Heat-energy and mechanical energy are mutually convertible
and have a definite equivalence, the British thermal
unit being equivalent to 772 foot-pounds of work, and the
metric <i>calorie</i> to 423.55, or, as usually taken, 424 kilogrammetres.
The exact measure is not fully determined, however.</p>

<p>It has now become generally admitted that all forms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
energy due to physical forces are mutually convertible with
a definite quantivalence; and it is not yet determined that
even vital and mental energy do not fall within the same
great generalization. This quantivalence is the sole basis
of the science of Energetics.</p>

<p>The study of this science has been, up to the present
time, principally confined to that portion which comprehends
the relations of heat and mechanical energy. In the
study of this department of the science, thermo-dynamics,
Rankine, Clausius, Thompson, Hirn, and others have acquired
great distinction. In the investigations which have
been made by these authorities, the methods of transfer of
heat and of modification of physical state in gases and vapors,
when a change occurs in the form of the energy considered,
have been the subjects of especial study.</p>

<p>According to the law of Boyle and Marriotte, the expansion
of such fluids follows a law expressed graphically
by the hyperbola, and algebraically by the expression
PV<sup><i>x</i></sup> = A, in which, with unchanging temperature, <i>x</i> is equal
to 1. One of the first and most evident deductions from the
principles of the equivalence of the several forms of energy
is that the value of x must increase as the energy expended
in expansion increases. This change is very marked with
a vapor like steam&mdash;which, expanded without doing work,
has an exponent less than unity, and which, when doing
work by expanding behind a piston, partially condenses, the
value of <i>x</i> increases to, in the case of steam, 1.111 according
to Rankine, or, probably more correctly, to 1.135 or more,
according to Zeuner and Grashof. This fact has an important
bearing upon the theory of the steam-engine, and
we are indebted to Rankine for the first complete treatise
on that theory as thus modified.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Port15" id="Port15"></a>
<img src="images/illo470.png" alt="Rankine" width="350" height="409" />
<p class="caption">Prof. W. J. M. Rankine.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Port15">Prof. Rankine</a> began his investigations as early as 1849,
at which time he proposed his theory of the molecular constitution
of matter, now well known as the theory of molecular
vortices. He supposes a system of whirling rings or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
vortices of heat-motion, and bases his philosophy upon that
hypothesis, supposing sensible heat to be employed in changing
the velocity of the particles, latent heat to be the work
of altering the dimensions of the orbits, and considering the
effort of each vortex to enlarge its boundaries to be due to
centrifugal force. He distinguished between real and apparent
specific heat, and showed that the two methods of
absorption of heat, in the case of the heating of a fluid, that
due to simple increase of temperature and that due to increase
of volume, should be distinguished; he proposed, for
the latter quantity, the term heat-potential, and for the sum
of the two, the name of thermo-dynamic function.</p>

<p>Carnot had stated, a quarter of a century earlier, that
the efficiency of a heat-engine is a function of the two limits
of temperature between which the machine is worked, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
not of the nature of the working substance&mdash;an assertion
which is quite true where the material does not change its
physical state while working. Rankine now deduced that
&#8220;general equation of thermo-dynamics&#8221; which expresses
algebraically the relations between heat and mechanical
energy, when energy is changing from the one state to the
other, in which equation is given, for any assumed change
of the fluids, the quantity of heat transformed. He showed
that steam in the engine must be partially liquefied by the
process of expanding against a resistance, and proved that
the total heat of a perfect gas must increase with rise of
temperature at a rate proportional to its specific heat under
constant pressure.</p>

<p>Rankine, in 1850, showed the inaccuracy of the then
accepted value, 0.2669, of the specific heat of air under constant
pressure, and calculated its value as 0.24. Three
years later, the experiments of Regnault gave the value
0.2379, and Rankine, recalculating it, made it 0.2377. In
1851, Rankine continued his discussion of the subject, and,
by his own theory, corroborated Thompson&#8217;s law giving the
efficiency of a perfect heat-engine as the quotient of the
range of working temperature to the temperature of the
upper limit, measured from the absolute zero.</p>

<p>During this period, Clausius, the German physicist, was
working on the same subject, taking quite a different
method, studying the mechanical effects of heat in gases,
and deducing, almost simultaneously with Rankine (1850),
the general equation which lies at the beginning of the
theory of the equivalence of heat and mechanical energy.
He found that the probable zero of heat-motion is at such a
point that the Carnot function must be approximately the
reciprocal of the &#8220;absolute&#8221; temperature, as measured with
the air thermometer, or, stated exactly, that quantity as determined
by a perfect gas thermometer. He confirmed Rankine&#8217;s
conclusion relative to the liquefaction of saturated
vapors when expanding against resistance, and, in 1854,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
adapted Carnot&#8217;s principle to the new theory, and showed
that his idea of the reversible engine and of the performance
of a cycle in testing the changes produced still held good,
notwithstanding Carnot&#8217;s ignorance of the true nature of
heat. Clausius also gave us the extremely important principle:
It is impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided, to
transfer heat from one body at a low temperature to another
having a higher temperature.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with Rankine and Clausius, Prof. William
Thomson was engaged in researches in thermo-dynamics
(1850). He was the first to express the principle of
Carnot as adapted to the modern theory by Clausius in the
now generally quoted propositions:<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a
href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>1. When equal mechanical effects are produced by purely
thermal action, equal quantities of heat are produced or
disappear by transformation of energy.</p>

<p>2. If, in any engine, a reversal effects complete inversion
of all the physical and mechanical details of its operation,
it is a perfect engine, and produces maximum effect with
any given quantity of heat and with any fixed limits of
range of temperature.</p>

<p>William Thomson and James Thompson showed, among
the earliest of their deductions from these principles, the fact,
afterward confirmed by experiment, that the melting-point
of ice should be lowered by pressure 0.0135&deg; Fahr, for each
atmosphere, and that a body which contracts while being
heated will always have its temperature decreased by sudden
compression. Thomson applied the principles of energetics
in extended investigations in the department of electricity,
while Helmholtz carried some of the same methods
into his favorite study of acoustics.</p>

<p>The application of now well-settled principles to the
physics of gases led to many interesting and important deductions:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
Clausius explained the relations between the volume,
density, temperature, and pressure of gases, and their
modifications; Maxwell re&euml;stablished the experimentally
determined law of Dalton and Charles, known also as that
of Gay-Lussac (1801), which asserts that all masses of equal
pressure, volume, and temperature, contain equal numbers
of molecules. On the Continent of Europe, also, Hirn,
Zeuner, Grashof, Tresca, Laboulaye, and others have, during
the same period and since, continued and greatly extended
these theoretical researches.</p>

<p>During all this time, a vast amount of experimental
work has also been done, resulting in the determination of
important data without which all the preceding labor would
have been fruitless. Of those who have engaged in such
work, Cagniard de la Tour, Andrews, Regnault, Hirn, Fairbairn
and Tate, Laboulaye, Tresca, and a few others have
directed their researches in this most important direction
with the special object of aiding in the advancement of the
new-born sciences. By the middle of the present century,
the time which we are now studying, this set of data was
tolerably complete. Boyle had, two hundred years before,
discovered and published the law, which is now known by
his name<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a
href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and by that of Marriotte,<a
name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that the pressure of a
gas varies inversely as its volume and directly as its density;
Dr. Black and James Watt discovered, a hundred years
later (1760), the latent heat of vapors, and Watt determined
the method of expansion of steam; Dalton, in England, and
Gay-Lussac, in France, showed, at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, that all gaseous fluids are expanded by
equal fractions of their volume by equal increments of temperature;
Watt and Robison had given tables of the elastic
force of steam, and Gren had shown that, at the temperature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
of boiling water, the pressure of steam was equal
to that of the atmosphere; Dalton, Ure, and others proved
(1800-1818) that the law connecting temperatures and pressures
of steam was expressed by a geometrical ratio; and
Biot had already given an approximate formula, when
Southern introduced another, which is still in use.</p>

<p>The French Government established a commission in
1823 to experiment with a view to the institution of legislation
regulating the working of steam-engines and boilers;
and this commission, MM. de Prony, Arago, Girard, and
Dulong, determined quite accurately the temperatures of
steam under pressures running up to twenty-four atmospheres,
giving a formula for the calculation of the one
quantity, the other being known. Ten years later, the Government
of the United States instituted similar experiments
under the direction of the Franklin Institute.</p>

<p>The marked distinction between gases, like oxygen and
hydrogen, and condensible vapors, like steam and carbonic
acid, had been, at this time, shown by Cagniard de la Tour,
who, in 1822, studied their behavior at high temperatures
and under very great pressures. He found that, when a
vapor was confined in a glass tube in presence of the same
substance in the liquid state, as where steam and water were
confined together, if the temperature was increased to a
certain definite point, the whole mass suddenly became of
uniform character, and the previously existing line of demarkation
vanished, the whole mass of fluid becoming, as
he inferred, gaseous. It was at about this time that Faraday
made known his then novel experiments, in which gases
which had been before supposed permanent were liquefied,
simply by subjecting them to enormous pressures. He then
also first stated that, above certain temperatures, liquefaction
of vapors was impossible, however great the pressure.</p>

<p>Faraday&#8217;s conclusion was justified by the researches of
Dr. Andrews, who has since most successfully extended the
investigation commenced by Cagniard de la Tour, and who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
shown that, at a certain point, which he calls the &#8220;critical
point,&#8221; the properties of the two states of the fluid fade into
each other, and that, at that point, the two become continuous.
With carbonic acid, this occurs at 75 atmospheres,
about 1,125 pounds per square inch, a pressure which would
counterbalance a column of mercury 60 yards, or nearly as
many metres, high. The temperature at this point is about
90&deg; Fahr., or 31&deg; Cent. For ether, the temperature is 370&deg;
Fahr., and the pressure 38 atmospheres; for alcohol, they
are 498&deg; Fahr., and 120 atmospheres; and for bisulphide of
carbon, 505&deg; Fahr., and 67 atmospheres. For water, the
pressure is too high to be determined; but the temperature
is about 775&deg; Fahr., or 413&deg; Cent.</p>

<p>Donny and Dufour have shown that these normal properties
of vapors and liquids are subject to modification by
certain conditions, as previously (1818) noted by Gay-Lussac,
and have pointed out the bearing of this fact upon the
safety of steam-boilers. It was discovered that the boiling-point
of water could be elevated far above its ordinary temperature
of ebullition by expedients which deprive the
liquid of the air usually condensed within its mass, and
which prevent contact with rough or metallic surfaces.
By suspension in a mixture of oils which is of nearly the
same density, Dufour raised drops of water under atmospheric
pressure to a temperature of 356&deg; Fahr.&mdash;180&deg; Cent.&mdash;the
temperature of steam of about 150 pounds per square
inch. Prof. James Thompson has, on theoretical grounds,
indicated that a somewhat similar action may enable vapor,
under some conditions, to be cooled below the normal temperature
of condensation, without liquefaction.</p>

<p>Fairbairn and Tate repeated the attempt to determine
the volume and temperature of water at pressures extending
beyond those in use in the steam-engine, and incomplete
determinations have also been made by others.</p>

<p>Regnault is the standard authority on these data. His
experiments (1847) were made at the expense of the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
Government, and under the direction of the French Academy.
They were wonderfully accurate, and extended through
a very wide range of temperatures and pressures. The results
remain standard after the lapse of a quarter of a century,
and are regarded as models of precise physical work.<a name="FNanchor_112_112"
id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Regnault found that the total heat of steam is not constant,
but that the latent heat varies, and that the sum of
the latent and sensible heats, or the total heat, increases
0.305 of a degree for each degree of increase in the sensible
heat, making 0.305 the specific heat of saturated steam. He
found the specific heat of superheated steam to be 0.4805.</p>

<p>Regnault promptly detected the fact that steam was not
subject to Boyle&#8217;s law, and showed that the difference is
very marked. In expressing his results, he not only tabulated
them but also laid them down graphically; he further
determined exact constants for Biot&#8217;s algebraic expression,</p>

<p class="ind10">log. <i>p</i> = <i>a</i> - <i>b</i>A<sup><i>x</i></sup> - <i>c</i>B<sup><i>x</i></sup>;</p>

<p>making <i>x</i> = 20 + <i>t</i>&deg; Cent.; <i>a</i> = 6.264035; log. <i>b</i> =
0.1397743; log. <i>c</i> = 0.6924351; log. A = <span class="bt">1</span>.9940493, and
log. B = <span class="bt">1</span>.9983439; <i>p</i> is the pressure in atmospheres.
Regnault, in the expression for the total heat, H = A + <i>bt</i>,
determined on the centigrade scale <i>&#952;</i> = 606.5 + 0.305 <i>t</i> Cent.

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>Since Regnault&#8217;s time, nothing of importance has been
done in this direction. There still remains much work to
be done in the extension of the research to higher pressures,
and under conditions which obtain in the operation of the
steam-engine. The volumes and densities of steam require
further study, and the behavior of steam in the engine is
still but little known, otherwise than theoretically. Even
the true value of Joule&#8217;s equivalent is not undisputed.</p>

<p>Some of the most recent experimental work bearing
directly upon the philosophy of the steam-engine is that of
Hirn, whose determination of the value of the mechanical
equivalent was less than two per cent. below that of Joule.
Hirn tested by experiment, in 1853, and repeatedly up to
1876, the analytical work of Rankine, which led to the conclusion
that steam doing work by expansion must become
gradually liquefied. Constructing a glass steam-engine
cylinder, he was enabled to see plainly the clouds of mist
which were produced by the expansion of steam behind the
piston, where Regnault&#8217;s experiments prove that the steam
should become drier and superheated, were no heat transformed
into mechanical energy. As will be seen hereafter,
this great discovery of Rankine is more important in its
bearing upon the theory of the steam-engine than any made
during the century. Hirn&#8217;s confirmation stands, in value,
beside the original discovery. In 1858 Hirn confirmed the
work of Mayer and Joule by determining the work done
and the carbonic acid produced, as well as the increased
temperature due to their presence, where men were set at
work in a treadmill; he found the elevation of temperature
to be much greater in proportion to gas produced when the
men were resting than when they were at work. He thus
proved conclusively the conversion of heat-energy into mechanical
work. It was from these experiments that Helmholtz
deduced the &#8220;modulus of efficiency&#8221; of the human
machine at one-fifth, and concluded that the heart works
with eight times the efficiency of a locomotive-engine, thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
confirming a statement of Rumford, who asserted the higher
efficiency of the animal.</p>

<p>Hirn&#8217;s most important experiments in this department
were made upon steam-engines of considerable size, including
simple and compound engines, and using steam sometimes
saturated and sometimes superheated to temperatures
as high, on some occasions, as 340&deg; Cent. He determined the
work done, the quantity of heat entering, and the amount
rejected from, the steam-cylinder, and thus obtained a
coarse approximation to the value of the heat-equivalent.
His figure varied from 296 to 337 kilogrammetres. But, in
all cases, the loss of heat due to work done was marked,
and, while these researches could not, in the nature of the
case, give accurate quantitative results, they are of great
value as qualitatively confirming Mayer and Joule, and
proving the transformation of energy.</p>

<p>Thus, as we have seen, experimental investigation and
analytical research have together created a new science,
and the philosophy of the steam-engine has at last been
given a complete and well-defined form, enabling the intelligent
engineer to comprehend the operation of the machine,
to perceive the conditions of efficiency, and to look
forward in a well-settled direction for further advances in
its improvement and in the increase of its efficiency.</p>

<p>A very concise <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the principal facts and laws
bearing upon the philosophy of the steam-engine will form
a fitting conclusion to this historical sketch.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;energy&#8221; was first used by Dr. Young as the
equivalent of the work of a moving body, in his hardly yet
obsolete &#8220;Lectures on Natural Philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Energy is the capacity of a moving body to overcome
resistance offered to its motion; it is measured either by
the product of the mean resistance into the space through
which it is overcome, or by the half-product of the mass of
the body into the square of its velocity. Kinetic energy is
the actual energy of a moving body; potential energy is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
the measure of the work which a body is capable of doing
under certain conditions which, without expending energy,
may be made to affect it, as by the breaking of a cord by
which a weight is suspended, or by firing a mass of explosive
material. The British measure of energy is the foot-pound;
the metric measure is the kilogrammetre.</p>

<p>Energy, whether kinetic or potential, may be observable
and due to mass-motion; or it may be invisible and due to
molecular movements. The energy of a heavenly body or
of a cannon-shot, and that of heat or of electrical action, are
illustrations of the two classes. In Nature we find utilizable
potential energy in fuel, in food, in any available head of
water, and in available chemical affinities. We find kinetic
energy in the motion of the winds and the flow of running
water, in the heat-motion of the sun&#8217;s rays, in heat-currents
on the earth, and in many intermittent movements of bodies
acted on by applied forces, natural or artificial. The potential
energy of fuel and of food has already been seen to
have been derived, at an earlier period, from the kinetic
energy of the sun&#8217;s rays, the fuel or the food being thus
made a storehouse or reservoir of energy. It is also seen
that the animal system is simply a &#8220;mechanism of transmission&#8221;
for energy, and does not create but simply diverts
it to any desired direction of application.</p>

<p>All the available forms of energy can be readily traced
back to a common origin in the potential energy of a universe
of nebulous substance (chaos), consisting of infinitely
diffused matter of immeasurably slight density, whose &#8220;energy
of position&#8221; had been, since the creation, gradually
going through a process of transformation into the several
forms of kinetic and potential energy above specified,
through intermediate methods of action which are usually
still in operation, such as the potential energy of chemical
affinity, and the kinetic forms of energy seen in solar radiation,
the rotation of the earth, and the heat of its interior.</p>

<p>The <i>measure</i> of any given quantity of energy, whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
may be its form, is the product of the resistance which it
is capable of overcoming into the space through which it
can move against that resistance, i. e., by the product RS.
Or it is measured by the equivalent expressions <span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>MV<span class="enum">2</span>, or
WV<span class="enum">2</span>/2<i>g</i>, in which W is the weight, M is the &#8220;mass&#8221; of matter
in motion, V the velocity, and <i>g</i> the dynamic measure
of the force of gravity, 32<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">6</span> feet, or 9.8 metres, per second.</p>

<p>There are three great laws of energetics:</p>

<p>1. The sum total of the energy of the universe is invariable.</p>

<p>2. The several forms of energy are interconvertible,
and possess an exact quantitative equivalence.</p>

<p>3. The tendency of all forms of kinetic energy is continually
toward reduction to forms of molecular motion,
and to their final dissipation uniformly throughout space.</p>

<p>The history of the first two of these laws has already
been traced. The latter was first enunciated by Prof. Sir
William Thomson in 1853. Undissipated energy is called
&#8220;Entrophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The science of thermo-dynamics is, as has been stated, a
branch of the science of energetics, and is the only branch
of that science in the domain of the physicist which has
been very much studied. This branch of science, which is
restricted to the consideration of the relations of heat-energy
to mechanical energy, is based upon the great fact
determined by Rumford and Joule, and considers the behavior
of those fluids which are used in heat-engines as the
media through which energy is transferred from the one
form to the other. As now accepted, it assumes the correctness
of the hypothesis of the dynamic theory of fluids,
which supposes their expansive force to be due to the motion
of their molecules.</p>

<p>This idea is as old as Lucretius, and was distinctly expressed
by Bernouilli, Le Sage and Pr&eacute;vost, and Herapath.
Joule recalled attention to this idea, in 1848, as explaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the pressure of gases by the impact of their molecules upon
the sides of the containing vessels. Helmholtz, ten years
later, beautifully developed the mathematics of media composed
of moving, frictionless particles, and Clausius has
carried on the work still further.</p>

<p>The general conception of a gas, as held to-day, including
the vortex-atom theory of Thomson and Rankine,
supposes all bodies to consist of small particles called molecules,
each of which is a chemical aggregation of its ultimate
parts or atoms. These molecules are in a state of
continual agitation, which is known as heat-motion. The
higher the temperature, the more violent this agitation;
the total quantity of motion is measured as <i>vis viva</i> by the
half-product of the mass into the square of the velocity of
molecular movement, or in heat-units by the same product
divided by Joule&#8217;s equivalent. In solids, the range of motion
is circumscribed, and change of form cannot take place.
In fluids, the motion of the molecules has become sufficiently
violent to enable them to break out of this range,
and their motion is then no longer definitely restricted.</p>

<p>The laws of thermo-dynamics are, according to Rankine:</p>

<p>1. Heat-energy and mechanical energy are mutually
convertible, one British thermal unit being the equivalent
in heat-energy of 772 foot-pounds of mechanical energy,
and one metric <i>calorie</i> equal to 423.55 kilogrammetres of
work.</p>

<p>2. The energy due to the heat of each of the several
equal parts into which a uniformly hot substance may be
divided is the same; and the total heat-energy of the mass
is equal to the sum of the energies of its parts.<a name="FNanchor_113_113"
id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>It follows that the work performed by the transformation
of the energy of heat, during any indefinitely small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
variation of the state of a substance as respects temperature,
is measured by the product of the absolute temperature
into the variation of a &#8220;function,&#8221; which function is
the rate of variation of the work so done with temperature.
This function is the quantity called by Rankine the &#8220;heat-potential&#8221;
of the substance for the given kind of work. A
similar function, which comprehends the total heat-variation,
including both heat transformed and heat needed to
effect accompanying physical changes, is called the &#8220;thermo-dynamic
function.&#8221; Rankine&#8217;s expression for the general
equation of thermo-dynamics includes the latter, and is
given by him as follows:</p>

<p class="ind10">J<i>dh</i> = <i>d</i>H = <i>kd&#964;</i> + <i>&#964;d</i>F = <i>&#964;d&#966;</i>,</p>

<p>in which J is Joule&#8217;s equivalent, <i>dh</i> the variation of total
heat in the substance, <i>kd&#964;</i> the product of the &#8220;dynamic
specific heat&#8221; into the variation of temperature, or the total
heat demanded to produce other changes than a transformation
of energy, and <i>&#964;d</i>F is the work done by the transformation
of heat-energy, or the product of the absolute
temperature, <i>&#964;</i>, into the differential of the heat-potential.
<i>&#966;</i> is the thermo-dynamic function, and <i>&#964;d&#966;</i> measures the
whole heat needed to produce, simultaneously, a certain
amount of work or of mechanical energy, and, at the same
time, to change the temperature of the working substance.</p>

<p>Studying the behavior of gases and vapors, it is found
that the work done when they are used, like steam, in heat-engines,
consists of three parts:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The change effected in the total actual heat-motion
of the fluid.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) That heat which is expended in the production of
internal work.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) That heat which is expended in doing the external
work of expansion.</p>

<p>In any case in which the total heat expended exceeds
that due the production of work on external bodies, the excess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
so supplied is so much added to the intrinsic energy of
the substance absorbing it.</p>

<p>The application of these laws to the working of steam
in the engine is a comparatively recent step in the philosophy
of the steam-engine, and we are indebted to Rankine
for the first, and as yet only, extended and in any respect
complete treatise embodying these now accepted principles.</p>

<p>It was fifteen years after the publication of the first
logical theory of the steam-engine, by Pambour,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a
href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> before
Rankine, in 1859, issued the most valuable of all his works,
&#8220;The Steam-Engine and other Prime Movers.&#8221; The work
is far too abstruse for the general reader, and is even difficult
reading for many accomplished engineers. It is excellent
beyond praise, however, as a treatise on the thermo-dynamics
of heat-engines. It will be for his successors the
work of years to extend the application of the laws which
he has worked out, and to place the results of his labors
before students in a readily comprehended form.</p>

<p>William J. Macquorn Rankine, the Scotch engineer and
philosopher, will always be remembered as the author of
the modern philosophy of the steam-engine, and as the
greatest among the founders of the science of thermo-dynamics.
His death, while still occupying the chair of engineering
at the University of Glasgow, December 24, 1872,
at the early age of fifty-two, was one of the greatest losses
to science and to the profession which have occurred during
the century.</p>

<p>As has been already stated, the steam-engine is a machine
which is especially designed to transform energy,
originally dormant or potential, into active and usefully
available kinetic energy.</p>

<p>When, millions of years ago, in that early period which
the geologists call the carboniferous, the kinetic energy of
the sun&#8217;s rays, and of the glowing interior of the earth,
was expended in the decomposition of the vast volumes of
carbonic acid with which air was then charged, and in the
production of a life-sustaining atmosphere and of the immense
forests which then covered the earth with their almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
inconceivably luxuriant vegetation, there was stored up
for the benefit of the human race, then uncreated, an inconceivably
great treasure of potential energy, which we are
now just beginning to utilize. This potential energy becomes
kinetic and available wherever and whenever the
powerful chemical affinity of oxygen for carbon is permitted
to come into play; and the fossil fuel stored in our coal-beds
or the wood of existing forests is, by the familiar process
of combustion, permitted to return to the state of combination
with oxygen in which it existed in the earliest geological
periods.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the steam-engine, therefore, traces
the changes which occur from this first step, by which, in
the furnace of the steam-boiler, this potential energy which
exists in the tendency of carbon and oxygen to combine to
form carbonic acid is taken advantage of, and the utilizable
kinetic energy of heat is produced in equivalent amount,
to the final application of resulting mechanical energy to
machinery of transmission, through which it is usefully
applied to the elevation of water, to the driving of mills
and machinery of all kinds, or to the hauling of &#8220;lightning&#8221;
trains on our railways, or to the propulsion of the
Great Eastern.</p>

<p>The kinetic heat-energy developed in the furnace of the
steam-boiler is partly transmitted through the metallic
walls which inclose the steam and water within the boiler,
there to evaporate water, and to assume that form of energy
which exists in steam confined under pressure, and is
partly carried away into the atmosphere in the discharged
gaseous products of combustion, serving, however, a useful
purpose, <i>en route</i>, by producing the draught needed to keep
up combustion.</p>

<p>The steam, with its store of heat-energy, passes through
tortuous pipes and passages to the steam-cylinder of the
engine, losing more or less heat on the way, and there expands,
driving the piston before it, and losing heat by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
transformation of that form of energy while doing mechanical
work of equivalent amount. But this steam-cylinder is
made of metal, a material which is one of the best conductors
of heat, and therefore one of the very worst possible
substances with which to inclose anything as subtile and
difficult of control as the heat pervading a condensible
vapor like steam. The process of internal condensation and
re&euml;vaporation, which is the great enemy of economical
working, thus has full play, and is only partly checked by
the heat from the steam-jacket, which, penetrating the cylinder,
assists by keeping up the temperature of the internal
surface and checking the first step, condensation, which is
an essential preliminary to the final waste by re&euml;vaporation.
The piston, too, is of metal, and affords a most excellent
way of exit for the heat escaping to the exhaust side.</p>

<p>Finally, all unutilized heat rejected from the steam-cylinder
is carried away from the machine, either by the water
of condensation, or, in the non-condensing engine, by the
atmosphere into which it is discharged.</p>

<p>Having traced the method of operation of the steam-engine,
it is easy to discover what principles are comprehended
in its philosophy, to learn what are known facts
bearing upon its operation, and to determine what are the
directions in which improvement must take place, what are
the limits beyond which improvement cannot possibly be
carried, and, in some directions, to determine what is the
proper course to pursue in effecting improvements. The
general direction of change in the past, as well as at present,
is easily seen, and it may usually be assumed that there
will be no immediate change of direction in a course which
has long been preserved, and which is well defined. We
may, therefore, form an idea of the probable direction in
which to look for improvement in the near future.</p>

<p>Reviewing the operations which go on in this machine
during the process of transformation of energy which has
been outlined, and studying it more in detail, we may deduce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the principles which govern its design and construction,
guide us in its management, and determine its efficiency.</p>

<p>In the furnace of the boiler, the quantity of heat developed
in available form is proportional to the amount of
fuel burned. It is available in proportion to the temperature
attained by the products of combustion; were this
temperature no higher than that of the boiler, the heat
would all pass off unutilized. But the temperature produced
by a given quantity of heat, measured in heat-units,
is greater as the volume of gas heated is less. It follows
that, at this point, therefore, the fuel should be perfectly
consumed with the least possible air-supply, and the least
possible abstraction of heat before combustion is complete.
High temperature of furnace, also, favors complete combustion.
We hence conclude that, in the steam-boiler furnace,
fuel should be burned completely in a chamber having non-conducting
walls, and with the smallest air-supply compatible
with thorough combustion; and, further, that the air
should be free from moisture, that greatest of all absorbents
of heat, and that the products of combustion should
be removed from the furnace before beginning to drain
their heat into the boiler. A fire-brick furnace, a large
combustion-chamber with thorough intermixture of gases
within it, good fuel, and a restricted and carefully-distributed
supply of air, seem to be the conditions which meet
these requisites best.</p>

<p>The heat generated by combustion traverses the walls
which separate the gases of the furnace from the steam and
water confined within the boiler, and is then taken up by
those fluids, raising their temperature from that of the entering
&#8220;feed-water&#8221; to that due the steam-pressure, and
expanding the liquid into steam occupying a greatly-increased
volume, thus doing a certain amount of work, besides
increasing temperature. The extent to which heat
may thus be usefully withdrawn from the furnace-gases
depends upon the conductivity of the metallic wall, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
rate at which the water will take heat from the metal, and
the difference of temperature on the two sides of the metal.
Extended &#8220;heating-surface,&#8221; therefore, a metal of high conducting
power, and a maximum difference of temperature
on the two sides of the separating wall of metal, are the
essential conditions of economy here. The heating-surface
is sometimes made of so great an area that the temperature
of the escaping gases is too low to give good chimney-draught,
and a &#8220;mechanical draught&#8221; is resorted to, revolving
&#8220;fan-blowers&#8221; being ordinarily used for its production.
It is most economical to adopt this method. The
steam-boiler is generally constructed of iron&mdash;sometimes,
but rarely, of cast-iron, although &#8220;steel,&#8221; where not hard
enough to harden or temper, is better in consequence of its
greater strength and homogeneousness of structure, and its
better conductivity. The maximum conductivity of flow
of heat for any given material is secured by so designing
the boiler as to secure rapid, steady, and complete circulation
of the water within it. The maximum rapidity of
transfer throughout the whole area of heating-surface is
secured, usually, by taking the feed-water into the boiler
as nearly as possible at the point where the gases are discharged
into the chimney-flue, withdrawing the steam nearer
the point of maximum temperature of flues, and securing
opposite directions of flow for the gases on the one side
and the water on the other. Losses of heat from the boiler,
by conduction and radiation to surrounding bodies, are
checked as far as possible by non-conducting coverings.</p>

<p>The mechanical equivalent of the heat generated in the
boiler is easily calculated when the conditions of working
are known. A pound of pure carbon has been found to be
capable of liberating by its perfect combustion, resulting in
the formation of carbonic acid, 14,500 British thermal units,
equivalent to 14,500 &times; 772 = 11,194,000 foot-pounds of work,
and, if burned in one hour, to <span class="enum">11194000</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">1980000</span> = 5.6 horse-power.
In other words, with perfect utilization, but <span class="enum">10</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">56</span> = 0.177,
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
about one-sixth, of a pound of carbon would be needed
per hour for each horse-power of work done. But even
good coal is not nearly all carbon, and has but about nine-tenths
this heat-producing power, and it is usually rated as
yielding about 10,000,000 foot-pounds of work per pound.
The evaporative power of pure carbon being rated at 15
pounds of water, that of good coal may be stated at 13<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>.
In metric measures, one gramme of good coal should evaporate
about 13<span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span> grammes of water from the boiling-point,
producing the equivalent of about 3,000,000 kilogrammetres
of work from the 7,272 <i>calories</i> of heat thus generated. A
gramme of pure carbon generates in its combustion 8,080
<i>calories</i> of heat. Per hour and per horse-power, 0.08, or
less than one-twelfth, of a kilogram of carbon burned
per hour evolves heat-energy equal to one horse-power.</p>

<p>Of the coal burned in a steam-boiler, it rarely happens
that more than three-fourths is utilized in making steam;
7,500,000 foot-pounds (1,036,898 kilogrammetres) is, therefore,
as much energy as is usually sent to the engine per
pound of good coal burned in the steam-boiler. The
&#8220;efficiency&#8221; of a good steam-boiler is therefore usually
not far from 0.75 as a maximum. Rankine estimates this
quantity for ordinary boilers of good design and with
chimney-draught at</p>

a formula of fairly close approximation for general practice.</p>

<p>The steam in the engine first drives the piston some distance
before the induction or steam valve is closed, and it
then expands, doing work, and condensing in proportion to
work done as the expansion proceeds, until it is finally released
by the opening of the exhaust or eduction valve.
Saturated steam is modified in its action by a process which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
has already been described, condensing at the beginning
and re&euml;vaporating at the end of the stroke, thus carrying
into the condenser considerable quantities of heat which
should have been utilized in the development of power.
Whether this operation takes place in one cylinder or in
several is only of importance in so far as it modifies the losses
due to conduction and radiation of heat, to condensation
and re&euml;vaporation of steam, and to the friction of the
machine. It has already been seen how these losses are
modified by the substitution of the compound for the single-cylinder
engine.</p>

<p>The laws of thermo-dynamics teach, as has been stated,
that the proportion of the heat-energy contained in the steam
or other working fluid which may be transformed into
mechanical energy is a fraction <span class="enum">(H<sub>1</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>)</span>&#8725;<span

measuring from the absolute zero of heat-motion. In perfect

<p>but in imperfect gases, and especially in vapors which, like
steam, condense, or otherwise change their physical state,
this equality may still exist, <span class="enum">(H<span class="sub">1</span> - H<span class="sub">2</span>)</span>&#8725;<span
class="denom">H<span class="sub">1</span></span> = <span

class="denom">&#964;<span class="sub">1</span></span>; and the
fluid is equally efficient with the perfect gas as a working
substance in a heat-engine. In any case it is seen that the
efficiency is greatest when the whole of the heat is received
at the maximum and rejected at the minimum attainable
temperatures.</p>

<p>Assuming this expression strictly accurate, a hot-air
engine working from 413.6&deg; Fahr, or 874.8&deg; absolute temperature,
down to 122&deg; Fahr, or 583.2&deg; absolute, should have
an efficiency of 0.263, transforming that proportion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
available heat into mechanical work. The engines of the
steamer Ericsson closely approached this figure, and gave a
horse-power for each 1.87 pound of coal burned per hour.</p>

<p>Steam expands in the steam-cylinder quite differently
under different circumstances. If no heat is either communicated
to it or abstracted from it, however, it expands in
an hyperbolic curve, losing its tension much more rapidly
than when expanded without doing work, in consequence
both of its change of volume and its condensation. The
algebraic expression for this method of expansion is, according
to Rankine, PV<span class="enum">1.111</span> = C, a constant, or, according to
other authorities, from PV<span class="enum">1.135</span> = C to PV<span class="enum">1.140</span> = C. The
greater the value of the exponent of V, the greater the efficiency
of the fluid between any two temperatures. The
maximum value has been found to be given where the
steam is saturated, but perfectly dry, at the commencement
of its expansion. The loss due to condensation on the
cooled interior surface of the cylinder at the commencement
of the stroke and the subsequent re&euml;vaporation as
expansion progresses is least when the cylinder is kept hot
by its steam-jacket and when least time is given during
the stroke for this transfer of heat between the metal and
the vapor.</p>

<p>It may be said that, all things considered, therefore,
losses of heat in the steam-cylinder are least when the steam
enters dry, or moderately superheated, where the interior
surfaces are kept hottest by the steam-jacket or by the
hot-air jacket sometimes used, and where piston-speed and
velocity of rotation are highest.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a
href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The best of compound
engines, using steam of seventy-five pounds pressure and
condensing, usually require about two pounds of coal per
hour&mdash;20,000,000 foot-pounds of energy at the furnace&mdash;to
develop a horse-power, i. e., about ten times the heat-equivalent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of the mechanical work which they accomplish.
Were the steam to expand like the permanent gases, they
would have a theoretical efficiency of about one-quarter;
actually, the efficiency is only one-tenth. The steam-engine,
therefore, utilizes about two-fifths the heat-energy theoretically
available with the best type of engine in general
use. By far the greater part, nearly all, in fact, of the nine-tenths
wasted is rejected in the exhaust steam, and can only
be saved by some such method as is hereafter to be suggested
of retaining that heat and returning it to the boiler.</p>

<p>The mechanical power which has now been communicated
to the mechanism of the engine by the transfer of the
kinetic energy of the hot steam to the piston is finally usefully
applied to whatever &#8220;mechanism of transmission&#8221;
forms the connection with the machinery driven by the engine.
In this transfer, there is some loss in the engine itself,
by friction. This is an extremely variable amount, and
it can be made very small by skillful design and good workmanship
and management. It may be taken at one-half
pound per square inch of piston for good engines of 100
horse-power and upward, but is often several pounds in very
small engines. It is least when the rubbing surfaces are of
different materials, but both of smooth, hard, close-grained
metal, well lubricated, and where advantage is taken of any
arrangement of parts which permits the equilibration of
pressure, as on the shaft-bearings of double and triple engines.
The friction of a steam-engine of large size and
good design is usually between five and seven per cent. of
its total power. It increases rapidly as the size of engine
decreases.</p>

<p>Having now traced somewhat minutely the growth of
the steam-engine from the beginning of the Christian era to
the present time, having rapidly outlined the equally gradual,
though intermittent, growth of its philosophy, and having
shown how the principles of science find application in the
operation of this wonderful machine, we are now prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
to study the conditions which control the intelligent designer,
and to endeavor to learn what are the lessons taught us
by science and by experience in regard to the essential requisites
of efficient working of steam and economy in the
consumption of fuel. We may even venture to point out
definitely the direction in which improvement is now progressing
as indicated by a study of these requisites, and may
be able to perceive the natural limits to such progress, and
possibly to conjecture what must be the character of that
change of type which only can take the engineer beyond
the limit set to his advance so long as he is confined to the
construction of the present type of engine.</p>

<p>First, we must consider the question: <i>What is the
problem, stated precisely and in its most general form, that
engineers have been here attempting to solve?</i></p>

<p>After stating the problem, we will examine the record
with a view to determine what direction the path of improvement
has taken hitherto, to learn what are the conditions
of efficiency which should govern the construction of
the modern steam-engine, and, so far as we may judge the
future by the past, by inference, to ascertain what appears
to be the proper course for the present and for the immediate
future. Still further, we will inquire, what are the
conditions, physical and intellectual, which best aid our
progress in perfecting the steam-engine.</p>

<p>This most important problem may be stated in its most
general, yet definite, form as follows:</p>

<p><i>To construct a machine which shall, in the most perfect
manner possible, convert the kinetic energy of heat into
mechanical power, the heat being derived from the combustion
of fuel, and steam being the receiver and the conveyer
of that heat.</i></p>

<p>The problem, as we have already seen, embodies two
distinct and equally important inquiries:</p>

<p>The first: What are the scientific principles involved in
the problem as stated?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>The second: How shall a machine be constructed that
shall most efficiently embody, and accord with, not only
those scientific principles, but also all of those principles of
engineering practice that so vitally affect the economical
value of every machine?</p>

<p>The one question is addressed to the man of science, the
other to the engineer. They can be satisfactorily answered,
even so far as our knowledge at present permits, after studying
with care the scientific principles involved in the theory
of the steam-engine under the best light that science can
afford us, and by a careful study of the various steps of improvement
that have taken place and of accompanying variations
of structure, analyzing the effect of each change, and
tracing the reasons for them.</p>

<p>The theory of the steam-engine is too important and
too extensive a subject to be satisfactorily treated here in
even the most concise possible manner. I can only attempt
a plain statement of the course which seems to be pointed
out by science as the proper one to pursue in the endeavor
to increase the economical efficiency of steam-engines.</p>

<p>The teachings of science indicate that <i>success in economically
deriving mechanical power from the energy of heat-motion
will, in all cases, be the greater as we work between
more widely separated limits of temperature, and as we
more perfectly provide against losses by dissipation of heat
in directions in which it is unavailable for the production
of power</i>.</p>

<p>Scientific research, as we have seen, has proved that, in
all known varieties of heat-engine, a large loss of effect is
unavoidable from the fact that we cannot, in the ordinary
steam-engine, reduce the lower limit of temperature, in
working, below a point which is far above the absolute
zero of temperature&mdash;far above that point at which bodies
have no heat-motion. The point corresponding to the mean
temperature of the surface of the earth is above the ordinary
lower limit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>The higher the temperature of the steam when it enters
the steam cylinder, and the lower that which it reaches before
the exhaust occurs, the greater, science tells us, will be
our success, provided we at the same time avoid waste of
heat and power.</p>

<p>Now, looking back over the history of the steam-engine,
we may briefly note the prominent improvements and the
most striking changes of form, and may thus endeavor to
obtain some idea of the general direction in which we are
to look for further advance.</p>

<p>Beginning with the machine of Porta, at which point we
may first take up an unbroken thread, it will be remembered
that we there found a single vessel performing the functions
of all the parts of a modern pumping-engine; it was, at
once, boiler, steam-cylinder, and condenser, as well as both
a lifting and a forcing pump.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester divided the engine into two
parts, using a separate boiler.</p>

<p>Savery duplicated that part of the engine of Worcester
which performed the several parts of pump, steam-cylinder,
and condenser, and added the use of water to effect rapid
condensation, perfecting, so far as it was ever perfected, the
steam-engine as a simple machine.</p>

<p>Newcomen and Calley next separated the pump from
the steam-engine proper, producing the modern steam-engine&mdash;the
engine as a train of mechanism; and in their engine,
as in Savery&#8217;s, we noticed the use of surface condensation
first, and subsequently that of the jet thrown into the
midst of the steam to be condensed.</p>

<p>Watt finally effected the crowning improvements, and
completed the movement o&pound; &#8220;differentiation&#8221; by separating
the condenser from the steam-cylinder. Here this process
of change ceased, the several important operations of the
steam-engine now being conducted each in a separate vessel.
The boiler furnished the steam, the cylinder derived from it
mechanical power, and it was finally condensed in a separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
vessel, while the power which had been obtained from it in
the steam-cylinder was transmitted through still other parts,
to the pumps, or wherever work was to be done.</p>

<p>Watt, also, took the initiative in another direction. He
continually increased the efficiency of the machine by improving
the proportions of its parts and the character of its
workmanship, thus making it possible to render available
many of those improvements in detail upon which effectiveness
is so greatly dependent and which are only useful when
made by a skillful workman.</p>

<p>Watt and his contemporaries also commenced that movement
toward higher pressures of steam and greater expansion
which has been the most striking feature noticed in the
progress of steam-engineering since his time. Newcomen
used steam of barely more than atmospheric pressure and
raised 105,000 pounds of water one foot high with a pound
of coal consumed. Smeaton raised the pressure somewhat
and increased the duty considerably. Watt started with a
duty double that of Newcomen and raised it to 320,000
foot-pounds per pound of coal, with steam at 10 pounds
pressure. To-day, Cornish engines of the same general plan
as those of Watt, but worked with 40 to 60 pounds of steam
and expanding three or four times, do a duty probably
averaging, with the better class of engines, 600,000 foot-pounds
per pound of coal. The compound pumping-engine
runs the figure up to above 1,000,000.</p>

<p>The increase in steam-pressure and in expansion since
Watt&#8217;s time has been accompanied by a very great improvement
in workmanship&mdash;a consequence, very largely,
of the rapid increase in perfection, and in the wide range
of adaptation of machine-tools&mdash;by higher skill and intelligence
in designing engines and boilers, by increased piston-speed,
greater care in obtaining dry steam, and in keeping
it dry until thrown out of the cylinder, either by steam-jacketing
or by superheating, or both combined; it has
further been accompanied by a greater attention to the important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
matter of providing carefully against losses by
radiation and conduction of heat. We use, finally, the
compound or double-cylinder engine for the purpose of saving
some of the heat usually lost in internal condensation
and re&euml;vaporation, and precipitation of condensed vapor
from great expansion.</p>

<p>It is evident that, although there is a limit, tolerably
well defined, in the scale of temperature, below which we
cannot expect to pass, a degree gained in approaching this
lower limit is more remunerative than a degree gained in
the range of temperature available by increasing temperatures.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a
href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Hence the attempt made by the French inventor, Du
Trembly, about the year 1850, and by other inventors since,
to utilize a larger proportion of heat by approaching more
closely the lower limit, was in accordance with known scientific
principles.</p>

<p>We may summarize the result of our examination of the
growth of the steam-engine thus:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The process of improvement has been one, primarily,
of &#8220;differentiation;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a
href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> the number of parts has been
continually increased; while the work of each part has been
simplified, a separate organ being appropriated to each process
in the cycle of operations.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> A kind of secondary process of differentiation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
has, to some extent, followed the completion of the
primary one, in which secondary process one operation is
conducted partly in one and partly in another portion of the
machine. This is illustrated by the two cylinders of the
compound engine and by the duplication noticed in the
binary engine.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The direction of improvement has been marked
by a continual increase of steam-pressure, greater expansion,
provision for obtaining dry steam, high piston-speed, careful
protection against loss of heat by conduction or radiation,
and, in marine engines, by surface condensation.</p>

<p>The direction which improvement seems now to be taking,
and the proper direction, as indicated by an examination
of the principles of science, as well as by our review of the
steps already taken, would seem to be: working between
the widest attainable limits of temperature.</p>

<p>Steam must enter the machine at the highest possible
temperature, must be protected from waste, and must retain,
at the moment before exhaust, the least possible amount of
heat. He whose inventive genius, or mechanical skill, contributes
to effect either the use of higher steam with safety
and without waste, or the reduction of the temperature of
discharge, confers a boon upon mankind.</p>

<p>In detail: In the engine, the tendency is, and may probably
be expected to continue, in the near future at least,
toward higher steam-pressure, greater expansion in more
than one cylinder, steam-jacketing, superheating, a careful
use of non-conducting protectors against waste, and the
adoption of still higher piston-speeds.</p>

<p>In the boiler: more complete combustion without excess
of air passing through the furnace, and more thorough absorption
of heat from the furnace-gases. The latter will
probably be ultimately effected by the use of a mechanically
produced draught, in place of the far more wasteful
method of obtaining it by the expenditure of heat in the
chimney.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>In construction we may anticipate the use of better materials,
and more careful workmanship, especially in the
boiler, and much improvement in forms and proportions of
details.</p>

<p>In management, there is a wide field for improvement,
which improvement we may feel assured will rapidly take
place, as it has now become well understood that great care,
skill, and intelligence are important essentials to the economical
management of the steam-engine, and that they
repay, liberally, all of the expense in time and money that
is requisite to secure them.</p>

<p>In attempting improvements in the directions indicated,
it would be the height of folly to assume that we have
reached a limit in any one of them, or even that we have
approached a limit. If further progress seems checked by
inadequate returns for efforts made, in any case, to advance
beyond present practice, it becomes the duty of the
engineer to detect the cause of such hinderance, and, having
found it, to remove it.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the movement toward the expansive
working of high steam was checked by experiments seeming
to prove positive disadvantage to follow advance beyond
a certain point. A careful revision of results, however,
showed that this was true only with engines built, as
was then common, in utter disregard of all the principles
involved in such a use of steam, and of the precautions
necessary to be taken to insure the gain which science
taught us should follow. The hinderances are mechanical,
and it is for the engineer to remove them.</p>

<p>The last remark is especially applicable to the work of
the engineer who is attempting to advance in the direction
in which, as already intimated, an unmistakable revolution
is now progressing, the modification of the modern steam-engine
to adapt it safely and successfully to run at the
high piston-speed, and great velocity of rotation which have
been already attained and which must undoubtedly be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
greatly exceeded in the future. As there is no known and
definite limit to the economical increase of speed, and as
the limit set by practical conditions is continually being set
farther back as the builder acquires greater skill and attains
greater accuracy of workmanship and the power to
insure greater rigidity of parts and durability of wearing
surfaces, we must anticipate a continued and indefinite
progress in this direction&mdash;a progress which must evidently
be of advantage, whatever may be the direction that other
changes may take.</p>

<p>It is evident that this adaptation of the steam-engine to
great speed of piston is the work now to be done by the
engineer. The requisites to success are obvious, and may be
concisely stated as follows:</p>

<p>1. Extreme accuracy in proportions.</p>

<p>2. Perfect accuracy in fitting parts to each other.</p>

<p>3. Absolute symmetry of journals.</p>

<p>4. Ample area and maximum durability of rubbing surfaces.</p>

<p>5. Perfect certainty of an ample and continuous lubrication.</p>

<p>6. A nicely calculated and adjusted balance of reciprocating
parts.</p>

<p>7. Security against injury by shock, whether due to the
presence of water in the cylinder or to looseness of running
parts.</p>

<p>8. A &#8220;positive-motion&#8221; cut-off gear.</p>

<p>9. A powerful but sensitive and accurately-working
governor determining the degree of expansion.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a
href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>10. Well-balanced valves and an easy-working valve-gear.</p>

<p>11. Small volume of &#8220;dead-space,&#8221; or &#8220;clearance,&#8221; and
properly adjusted &#8220;compression.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would seem sufficiently evident that the engine with
detachable (&#8220;drop&#8221;) cut-off valve-gear must, sooner or later,
become an obsolete type, although the substitution of springs
or of steam-pressure for gravity in the closing of the detached
valve may defer greatly this apparently inevitable
change. The &#8220;engine of the future&#8221; will not probably be
a &#8220;drop cut-off engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>As regards the construction of the engine as a piece of
mechanism, the principles and practice of good engineering
are precisely the same, whether applied in the designing of
the compound or of the ordinary type of steam-engine.
The proportioning of the two machines to each other in
such manner as to form an effective whole, by procuring
approximately equal amounts of work from both, is the
only essential peculiarity of compound-engine design which
calls for especial care, and the method of securing success
in practice may be stated to be, for both forms of engines,
as follows:</p>

<p>1. A good design, by which is meant&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Correct proportions, both in general dimensions and
in arrangement of parts, and proper forms and sizes of details
to withstand safely the forces which may be expected
to come upon them.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> A general plan which embodies the recognized practice
of good engineering.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Adaptation to the specific work which it is intended
to perform, in size and in efficiency. It sometimes happens
that good practice dictates the use of a comparatively uneconomical
design.</p>

<p>2. Good construction, by which is meant&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The use of good material.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Accurate workmanship.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Skillful fitting and a proper &#8220;assemblage&#8221; of parts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>3. Proper connection with its work, that it may do that
work under the conditions assumed in its design.</p>

<p>4. Skillful management by those in whose hands it is
placed.</p>

<p><i>In general</i>, it may be stated that, to secure maximum
economical efficiency, steam should be worked at as high a
pressure as possible, and the expansion should be fixed as
nearly as possible at the point of maximum economy for
that pressure. In general, the number of times which the
volume of steam may be expanded in the standard single-cylinder,
high-pressure engine with maximum economy, is
not far from <span class="enum">1</span>&#8725;<span class="denom">2</span>&#8730;<span class="bt">P</span>,
where P is the pressure in pounds per
square inch; it rarely exceeds 0.75&#8730;<span class="bt">P</span>. This may be exceeded
in double-cylinder engines. It is even more disadvantageous
to cut off too short than to &#8220;&#8216;follow&#8217; too far.&#8221;
With considerable expansion, steam-jacketing and moderate
superheating should be adopted, to prevent excessive
losses by internal condensation and re&euml;vaporation; and
expansion should take place in double cylinders, to avoid
excessive weight of parts, irregularity of motion, and great
loss by friction.</p>

<p>To secure this vitally important economy, it is advisable
to seek some practicable method of lining the cylinder with
a non-conducting material. This plan, as has been seen,
was adopted by Smeaton, in constructing Newcomen engines
a century ago. Smeaton used wood on his pistons,
and Watt tried wood as a material for steam-cylinder linings.
That material is too perishable at temperatures now
common, and no metal has yet been substituted, or even
discovered, which answers the same purpose. The loss will
also be reduced by increasing the speed of rotation and velocity
of piston. Where no effectual means can be found
of preventing contact of the steam with a good absorbent
and conductor of heat, it will be found best to sacrifice
some of the efficiency due to the change of state of the
vapor, by superheating it and sending it into the cylinder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
at a temperature considerably exceeding that of saturation.
With low steam and slowly-moving pistons, it is better to
pursue the latter course than to attempt to increase the efficiency
of the engine by greater expansion.</p>

<p>External surfaces should be carefully covered by non-conductors
and non-radiators, to prevent losses by conduction
and radiation of heat. It is especially necessary to
reduce back-pressure and to obtain the most perfect vacuum
possible without overloading the air-pump, if it is desired
to obtain the maximum efficiency by expansion, and it then
becomes also very necessary to reduce losses by &#8220;dead-spaces&#8221;
and by badly-adjusted valves.</p>

<p>The piston-speed should be as great as can be sustained
with safety.</p>

<p>Good engines should not require more than W = <span class="enum">200</span>&#8725;<span
class="denom">&#8730;<span class="bt">P</span></span>
where W = the weight of steam per hour and per horse-power;
the best practice gives about W = <span class="enum">180</span>&#8725;<span
class="denom">&#8730;<span class="bt">P</span></span> in large engines
with dry steam, high piston-speed, and good design,
construction, and management.</p>

<p>The expansion-valve gear should be simple. The point
of cut-off is perhaps best determined by the governor. The
valve should close rapidly, but without shock, and should
be balanced, or some other device should be adopted to
make it easy to move and free from liability to cutting or
rapid wear.</p>

<p>The governor should act promptly and powerfully, and
should be free from liability to oscillate, and to thus introduce
irregularities which are sometimes not less serious than
those which the instrument is intended to prevent.</p>

<p>Friction should be reduced as much as possible, and careful
provision should be made to economize lubricants as
well as fuel.</p>

<p>The Principles of Steam-Boiler Construction are exceedingly
simple; and although attempts are almost daily made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
to obtain improved results by varying the design and arrangement
of heating-surface, the best boilers of nearly all
makers of acknowledged standing are practically equal in
merit, although of very diverse forms.</p>

<p>In making boilers, the effort of the engineer should
evidently be:</p>

<p>1. To secure complete combustion of the fuel without
permitting dilution of the products of combustion by excess
of air.</p>

<p>2. To secure as high temperature of furnace as possible.</p>

<p>3. To so arrange heating-surfaces that, without checking
draught, the available heat shall be most completely
taken up and utilized.</p>

<p>4. To make the form of boiler such that it shall be
constructed without mechanical difficulty or excessive expense.</p>

<p>5. To give it such form that it shall be durable, under
the action of the hot gases and of the corroding elements
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>6. To make every part accessible for cleaning and repairs.</p>

<p>7. To make every part as nearly as possible uniform in
strength, and in liability to loss of strength by wear and
tear, so that the boiler when old shall not be rendered useless
by local defects.</p>

<p>8. To adopt a reasonably high &#8220;factor of safety&#8221; in
proportioning parts.</p>

<p>9. To provide efficient safety-valves, steam-gauges, and
other appurtenances.</p>

<p>10. To secure intelligent and very careful management.</p>

<p>In securing complete combustion, the first of these desiderata,
an ample supply of air and its thorough intermixture
with the combustible elements of the fuel are essential;
for the second&mdash;high temperature of furnace&mdash;it is necessary
that the air-supply shall not be in excess of that absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
needed to give complete combustion. The efficiency of a
furnace in making heat available is measured by</p>

<table class="center ind10" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="Formula_478">

<tr>
<td rowspan="2">E&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="center bb">T&nbsp;-&nbsp;T&#8242;</td>
<td rowspan="2">&nbsp;;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>T&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>t</i></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>in which E represents the ratio of heat utilized to the whole
calorific value of the fuel, T is the furnace-temperature,
T&#8242; the temperature of the chimney, and <i>t</i> that of the external
air. The higher the furnace-temperature and the lower
that of the chimney, the greater the proportion of heat
available. It is further evident that, however perfect the
combustion, no heat can be utilized if either the temperature
of the chimney approximates to that of the furnace, or
if the temperature of the furnace is reduced by dilution
approximately to that of the boiler. Concentration of
heat in the furnace is secured, in some cases, by special
expedients, as by heating the entering air, or as in the Siemens
gas-furnace, heating both the combustible gases and
the supporter of combustion. Detached fire-brick furnaces
have an advantage over the &#8220;fire-boxes&#8221; of steam-boilers
in their higher temperature; surrounding the fire with non-conducting
and highly heated surfaces is an effective method
of securing high furnace-temperature.</p>

<p>In arranging heating-surface, the effort should be to impede
the draught as little as possible, and so to place them
that the circulation of water within the boiler should be
free and rapid at every part reached by the hot gases. The
directions of circulation of water on the one side and of gas
on the other side of the sheet should, whenever possible, be opposite.
The cold water should enter where the cooled gases
leave, and the steam should be taken off farthest from that
point. The temperature of chimney-gases has thus been
reduced in practice to less than 300&deg; Fahr., and an efficiency
equal to 0.75 to 0.80 the theoretical has been attained.</p>

<p>The extent of heating-surface simply, in all of the best
forms of boiler, determines the efficiency, and in them the
disposition of that surface seldom affects it to any great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
extent. The area of heating-surface may also be varied
within very wide limits without very greatly modifying
efficiency. A ratio of 25 to 1 in flue and 30 to 1 in tubular
boilers represents the relative area of heating and grate
surfaces as chosen in the practice of the best-known builders.</p>

<p>The material of the boiler should be tough and ductile
iron, or, better, a soft steel containing only sufficient carbon
to insure melting in the crucible or on the hearth of the
melting-furnace, and so little that no danger may exist of
hardening and cracking under the action of sudden and
great changes of temperature.</p>

<p>Where iron is used, it is necessary to select a somewhat
hard, but homogeneous and tough, quality for the fire-box
sheets or any part exposed to flames.</p>

<p>The factor of safety is invariably too low in this country,
and is never too high in Europe. Foreign builders are
more careful in this matter than our makers in the United
States. The boiler should be built strong enough to bear a
pressure at least six times the proposed working-pressure;
as the boiler grows weak with age, it should be occasionally
tested to a pressure far above the working-pressure, which
latter should be reduced gradually to keep within the bounds
of safety. In the United States, the factor of safety is
seldom more than four in the new boilers, frequently much
less, and even this is reduced practically to one and a third
by the operation of our inspection-laws.</p>

<p>The principles just enunciated are those generally, perhaps
universally, accepted principles which are stated in all
text-books of science and of steam-engineering, and are accepted
by both engineers and men of science.</p>

<p>These principles are correct, and the deductions which
have been here formulated are rigidly exact, as applied to
all types of heat-engine in use; and they lead us to the determination,
in all cases, of the &#8220;modulus&#8221; of efficiency of
the engine, i. e., to the calculation of the ratio of its actual
efficiency to that efficiency which it would have, were it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
absolutely free from loss of heat by conduction or radiation,
or other method of loss of heat or waste of power, by friction
of parts or by shock.</p>

<p>The best modern marine compound engines sometimes,
as we have seen, consume as little as two pounds of coal per
horse-power and per hour; but this is but about one-tenth
the power derivable from the fuel, were all its heat thoroughly
utilized. This loss may be divided thus: 70 per
cent. rejected in exhausted steam; 20 per cent. lost by conduction
and radiation and by faults of mechanism and design;
and only the 10 per cent. remaining is utilized. Thirty
per cent. of the heat generated in the furnace is usually lost
in the chimney, and of the remainder, which enters the engine,
20 per cent. at most is all which we can hope to save
any portion of by improvements effected in our best existing
type of steam-engine. It has already been shown how
the engineer can best proceed in attempting this economy.</p>

<p>The direction in which further improvement must take
place in the standard type of engine is plainly that which
shall most efficiently check losses by internal condensation
and re&euml;vaporation by the transfer of heat to and from the
metal of the steam-cylinder. The condensation of steam
doing work is evidently not a disadvantage, but, on the contrary,
a decided advantage.</p>

<p>A new type of engine can, if at all, probably only
supersede the common form when engineers can employ
steam of very high pressure, and adopt much greater range
of expansion than is now usual. Great velocity of piston
and high speed of rotation are also essential in the attempt to
make any revolution in steam-engine construction a success.</p>

<p>When a new form of steam-engine is likely to be introduced,
if at all, can be scarcely even conjectured. It
seems evident that its success is to be secured, if a revolution
is ever to occur, by the adoption of high steam-pressures,
of great piston speeds, by care and skill in design,
by the use of exceptionally excellent materials of construction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
by great perfection of workmanship, and by intelligence
in its management.</p>

<p>Experiment and experience will probably lead gradually
to the general and safe employment of much higher steam-pressures
and very greatly increased piston-speeds, and may
ultimately reveal and remove all those difficulties which
must invariably be expected to be met here, as in all other
attempts to effect radical changes, however important they
may be.</p>

$1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The attempt at a connected account of the general physiology of muscles
and nerves is, as far as I know, the first of its kind. The general data for this
branch of science have been gained only within the past thirty years.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Extract

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It is pleasant to find an American book which can rank with the very best
of foreign works on this subject. Professor Le Conte has long been known as
an original investigator in this department; all that he gives us is treated with
a master-hand.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;There was need for a book like this, which discusses the atomic theory both
in its historic evolution and in its present form. And perhaps no man of this
age could have been selected so able to perform the task in a masterly way as
the illustrious French chemist, Adolph Wurtz. It is impossible to convey to the
reader, in a notice like this, any adequate idea of the scope, lucid instructiveness,
and scientific interest of Professor Wurtz&#8217;s book. The modern problems of
chemistry, which are commonly so obscure from imperfect exposition, are here
made wonderfully clear and attractive.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Popular Science Monthly.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Whoever will follow these pages, crayfish in hand, and will try to verify for
himself the statements which they contain, will find himself brought face to face,
with all the great zo&ouml;logical questions which excite so lively an interest at the

<p><b>SUICIDE</b>: An Essay In Comparative Moral Statistics. By <span class="smcap">Henry Morselli</span>, Professor
of Psychological Medicine in Royal University, Turin. 12mo, Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Suicide&#8221; is a scientific inquiry, on the basis of the statistical method, into the laws
of suicidal phenomena. Dealing with the subject as a branch of social science, it considers
the increase of suicide in different countries, and the comparison of nations,
races, and periods in its manifestation. The influences of age, sex, constitution, climate,
season, occupation, religion, prevailing ideas, the elements of character, and the
tendencies of civilization, are comprehensively analyzed in their bearing upon the propensity
to self-destruction. Professor Morselli is an eminent European authority on
this subject. It is accompanied by colored maps illustrating pictorially the results of
statistical inquiries.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In no field has modern research been more fruitful than in that of which Professor
Judd gives a popular account in the present volume. The great lines of dynamical,
geological, and meteorological inquiry converge upon the grand problem of the interior
constitution of the earth, and the vast influence of subterranean agencies.... His
book is very far from being a mere dry description of volcanoes and their eruptions; it
is rather a presentation of the terrestrial facts and laws with which volcanic phenomena
are associated.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Popular Science Monthly.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The volume before us is one of the pleasantest science manuals we have read for
some time.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Professor Young is an authority on &#8216;The Sun,&#8217; and writes from intimate knowledge.
He has studied that great luminary all his life, invented and improved instruments
for observing it, gone to all quarters of the world in search of the best places
and opportunities to watch it, and has contributed important discoveries that have
extended our knowledge of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take a cyclop&aelig;dia to represent all that has been done toward clearing up
the solar mysteries. Professor Young has summarized the information, and presented
it in a form completely available for general readers. There is no rhetoric in his book;
he trusts the grandeur of his theme to kindle interest and impress the feelings. His
statements are plain, direct, clear, and condensed, though ample enough for his purpose,
and the substance of what is generally wanted will be found accurately given in his
pages.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Popular Science Monthly.</i></p></div>

By <span class="smcap">James Sully</span>, author of &#8220;Sensation

<div class="blockquot"><p>This volume takes a wide survey of the field of error, embracing in its view not only
the illusions commonly regarded as of the nature of mental aberrations or hallucinations,
but also other illusions arising from that capacity for error which belongs essentially
to rational human nature. The author has endeavored to keep to a strictly scientific
treatment&mdash;that is to say, the description and classification of acknowledged errors,
and the exposition of them by a reference to their psychical and physical conditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not a technical work, but one of wide popular interest, in the principles and
results of which every one is concerned. The illusions of perception of the senses and
of dreams are first considered, and then the author passes to the illusions of introspection,
errors of insight, illusions of memory, and illusions of belief. The work is a noteworthy
contribution to the original progress of thought, and may be relied upon as
representing the present state of knowledge on the important subject to which it is
devoted.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Popular Science Monthly.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;No living physiologist is better entitled to speak with authority upon the
structure and functions of the brain than Dr. Luys. His studies on the anatomy
of the nervous system are acknowledged to be the fullest and most systematic
ever undertaken. Dr. Luys supports his conclusions not only by his own anatomical
researches, but also by many functional observations of various other
physiologists, including of course Professor Ferrier&#8217;s now classical experiments.&#8221;&mdash;<i>St.
James&#8217;s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Luys, at the head of the great French Insane Asylum, is one of the most
eminent and successful investigators of cerebral science now living; and he has
given unquestionably the clearest and most interesting brief account yet made of
the structure and operations of the brain. We have been fascinated by this volume
more than by any other treatise we have yet seen on the machinery of sensibility

<p><b>THE CONCEPTS AND THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS.</b> By
<span class="smcap">J. B. Stallo.</span> 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Judge Stallo&#8217;s work is an inquiry into the validity of those mechanical conceptions
of the universe which are now held as fundamental in physical science.
He takes up the leading modern doctrines which are based upon this mechanical
conception, such as the atomic constitution of matter, the kinetic theory of gases,
the conservation of energy, the nebular hypothesis, and other views, to find how
much stands upon solid empirical ground, and how much rests upon metaphysical
speculation. Since the appearance of Dr. Draper&#8217;s
&#8216;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1185">Religion and Science</a>,&#8217;
no book has been published in the country calculated to make so deep an impression

minuteness of the author&#8217;s learning, the acuteness of his reasoning, and the
singular precision and clearness of his style, are qualities which very seldom
have been jointly exhibited in a scientific treatise.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Mr. Darwin&#8217;s little volume on the habits and instincts of earth-worms is no
less marked than the earlier or more elaborate efforts of his genius by freshness
of observation, unfailing power of interpreting and correlating facts, and logical
vigor in generalizing upon them. The main purpose of the work is to point out
the share which worms have taken in the formation of the layer of vegetable
mould which covers the whole surface of the land in every moderately humid
country. All lovers of nature will unite in thanking Mr. Darwin for the new and
interesting light he has thrown upon a subject so long overlooked, yet so full of
interest and instruction, as the structure and the labors of the earth-worm.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Respecting worms as among the most useful portions of animate nature,
Dr. Darwin relates, in this remarkable book, their structure and habits, the part
they have played in the burial of ancient buildings and the denudation of the
land, in the disintegration of rocks, the preparation of soil for the growth of
plants, and in the natural history of the world.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p></div>

of &#8220;Origin of Civilization, and the Primitive Condition of Man,&#8221; etc., etc. With
Colored Plates. 12mo, cloth, $2.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;This volume contains the record of various experiments made with ants, bees, and
wasps during the last ten years, with a view to test their mental condition and powers
of sense. The principal point in which Sir John&#8217;s mode of experiment differs from
those of Huber, Forel, McCook, and others, is that he has carefully watched and
marked particular insects, and has had their nests under observation for long periods&mdash;one
of his ants&#8217; nests having been under constant inspection ever since 1874. His
observations are made principally upon ants because they show more power and flexibility
of mind; and the value of his studies is that they belong to the department of
original research.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no hesitation in saying that the author has presented us with the most
valuable series of observations on a special subject that has ever been produced, charmingly
written, full of logical deductions, and, when we consider his multitudinous engagements,
a remarkable illustration of economy of time. As a contribution to insect
psychology, it will be long before this book finds a parallel.&#8221;&mdash;<i>London Athen&aelig;um.</i></p></div>

Secretary of the Linn&aelig;an Society, etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My object in the work as a whole is twofold: First, I have thought it desirable
that there should be something resembling a text-book of the facts of Comparative
Psychology, to which men of science, and also metaphysicians, may turn whenever
they have occasion to acquaint themselves with the particular level of intelligence
to which this or that species of animal attains. My second and much more important
object is that of considering the facts of animal intelligence in their relation to the
theory of descent.&#8221;&mdash;<i>From the Preface.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Unless we are greatly mistaken, Mr. Romanes&#8217;s work will take its place as one
of the most attractive volumes of the &#8216;International Scientific Series.&#8217; Some persons
may, indeed, be disposed to say that it is too attractive, that it feeds the popular taste
for the curious and marvelous without supplying any commensurate discipline in
exact scientific reflection; but the author has, we think, fully justified himself in his
modest preface. The result is the appearance of a collection of facts which will be a
real boon to the student of Comparative Psychology for this is the first attempt to
present systematically well-assured observations on the mental life of animals.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The author believes himself, not without ample cause, to have completely bridged
the supposed gap between instinct and reason by the authentic proofs here marshaled
of remarkable intelligence in some of the higher animals. It is the seemingly
conclusive evidence of reasoning; powers furnished by the adaptation of means to ends
in cases which can not be explained on the theory of inherited aptitude or habit.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New

<p>&#8220;The author traces the subject from Plato and Aristotle in Greece, and Cicero in
Rome, to the modern schools in the English field, not slighting the teachings of the
American Revolution or the lessons of the French Revolution of 1793. Forms of government,
political terms, the relation of law, written and unwritten, to the subject, a
codification from Justinian to Napoleon in France and Field in America, are treated
as parts of the subject in hand. Necessarily the subjects of executive and legislative
authority, police, liquor, and land laws are considered, and the question ever growing
in importance in all countries, the relations of corporations to the state.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York

<p><b>MIND IN THE LOWER ANIMALS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE.</b>
By <span class="smcap">W. Lauder Lindsay, M. D., F. R. S. E.</span>, etc. 2 vols., 8vo. Cloth, $4.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The author of this work, which, regarded merely as an accumulation of
verified and classified facts, is a unique and precious contribution to the data of
comparative psychology, claims that he entered on his inquiry without any theory
to defend, support, or illustrate. We are bound to say that, while his general
conclusions are boldly and continually avowed, his claim of fairness and caution
is justified by his method of examining particular phenomena; that he seems
willing at all times to renounce any impression or belief which is shown to be
scientifically untenable.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;In this work&mdash;two volumes of over 500 pages&mdash;Dr. Lindsay marshals a proportionately
large number of facts against those philosophers who maintain that
the intelligence of man differs in kind and not simply in degree from that of the
lower animals. It is one purpose of his book to show that the main differences
between man and the lower animals exist rather in their physical than in their
mental structure. In this way of thinking, all animals possess not the semblance
of, but the true substance of mind and will.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York World.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;So far as we are aware there has been no treatise upon the subject of animal
intelligence so broad in its foundations, so well considered, or so scientific in its
methods of inquiry, as that which has been prepared by Dr. W. Lauder Lindsay
in two large volumes, the first being devoted to a study of animal mind in health,
and the second to animal mind in disease. We may safely say that his work is,
in some respects, the most important essay of the kind that has yet been undertaken.
His observations have been supplemented by a thorough mastery of the
history and literature of the subject, and hence his conclusions rest upon the
broadest possible foundation of safe induction. There is a good analytical index
to the book, as there ought to be to every work of the kind.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York Evening

the basis of all teaching, either in experimental or natural history science; and
this example has been generally followed. &#8220;But in most centers of education,&#8221;
writes Professor Cooke, &#8220;the old traditions so far survive that the great end of
scientific culture is lost in attempting to conform even laboratory instruction to
the old academic methods of recitations and examinations. To point out this
error, and to claim for science-teaching its appropriate methods, was one object
of writing these essays.&#8221;</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
